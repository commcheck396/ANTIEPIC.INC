So, after 116 hours of playing,  I think it\'s time to review the game.\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a very good game for those who love open world and city-exploration-type of game.\nThe original version was released in 2012, and the Definitive Edition was released in 2014.\nYou will play as Wei Shen, a member of Sun On Yee gang and a cop, at the same time\nPro:\n1. Better textures than the first release\n2. You don\'t need to purchase extra DLCs. It\'s all included in this DE pack\n3. You live in a beautiful landscape of Hong Kong, with vibrant city lights during the night, and with real-life situations of the HK city itself (the street food, the night market, the temple) they even have Victoria Peak too!\n4.  You can learn some new Cantonese-words and even some rant in Cantonese :P\n5. I love the theme song of the Zodiac Tournament trailer\n6. Upgrading the character is fun (finding Health Shrines, Jade Statues, Fire Opal Statues, Legendary Outfits, etc.)\nCons:\n1. Some movements seem unreal and impossibru (like the action hijack from car to car?) (I know it\'s a game, but C\'mon)\n2. They cut all the intimate scenes xD\n3. For a game with the size of about 17 GB, the storyline and gampelay is quite short\nTIPS;\n1. Click "add to wishlist" and buy it on sale. The highest discount so far for this game is 80% discount\n2. Own the DZS-90 Super Car, and shoot or EMP everyone and every car\n3. Play on maxed graphics setting\n4. Don\'t be a POK GAI, be the DAI LAO!\nFinal rating from me: 8.1/10', u'early_access': false, u'page': 255}

It\'s a great remake of Abe\'s Oddysee. This is one of my first games in the PSX console. So much improvements from the graphics and textures.\nPros:\n1. Abe\'s signature "I don\'t know" voice and gesture (this one is the most nostalgic part!)\n2. Abe\'s signature fart\n3. Abe\'s signature whistle\n4. Amazing graphics on max settings\n5. The quicksave and quickload feature [for me this is a plus, for some people it\'s a bad feature, almost considered as cheating. You decide ;) ]\n6. For a game with good graphics and long storyline, the game size is so reasonable with only around 9.8 gigabytes.\nCons:\n1. Some missing textures on Rupture Farms level\n2. Keyboard input delay (very rare ocassion)\n3. Gameplay still feels quite easy although the difficulty level is already set at hard.\nFinal rating from me:\n9.1/10', u'early_access': false, u'page': 16}

Watch those Big B***s bouncing everywhere while you slay aliens\n4. Funny with some explicit language and conversations :D\n5.  The quests, side quests and gameplay are quite long, considering the file size is only about 9.9 GB\nCons:\n1. Glitchy textures\n2.

The gameplay for which this game is without a doubt famous for, the lightsabre fighting on it's own is amazingly well crafted, the best in any starwars game by -far-. It's simply exceptionally, giving your three styles to choose from and several ways to use each one. Additionally you will command an array of powers that can be used to bolster said form to make you the ultimate Jedi or indeed fallen Jedi as several of the powers are indeed darkside...\nStorywise:(no 'great' spoilers) I think this hits me the hardest, a simple story it tells the story of Kyle Katarn and his love Jan Orso, as they assist the Jedi Academy under Luke Skywalker in one of their darkest hour as a rogue student turned Dark Jedi will attempt to destroy them.\nMix in a bit of love, vengence, redemption and friendship and then you have a brilliant story that is -truly- one of the best stories in EU...\nVideo: In short I've never put great importance on video, but still it's worth mentioning. This game is old and it can be seen. Now it's not that the graphics are bad but it cannot handle some resolutions that may bother, still this remains a beautiful game.\nOverall: I played this as a child so some Nostalgia might strike me, still the gameplay is exceptionally well and there is an -immense- replay value. The story too is excellent and in my humble opinion one of the best EU stories.\nStarwars fans and non-fans will adore this, I can tell you because when I was a kid even my mother played it and she was most certainly not a fan of starwars.\nTrivia! Kyle Katarn(protagonist)  was according the EU the mercenary who stole the original deathstar plans!

I've played this game for some 40 hours as I write this and consider myself competent.\nThe game is based on squads, each squad with different roles and different weapons which is supposed to give each squad advantages and disadvantages. There are ofcourse desirable roles and undesirable but it is quite fair and you get a share of both. It is ofcourse set in ww1 with authentic weapons and trenches as well as uniforms and it is well balanced.\nThe game is as of currents still in Beta but I must honestly say, I haven't had higher expectations for a game. There are obvious fault I remember when gas (which is awesome) came out it was bulletproof, this like many other bugs are quickly fixed and new updates are added frequently.\nThe objectives of the game is to simply capture the enemy position and push them out of the map or have the most points when the time runs out. Points are given for succesfull conquest of trenches and objectives.\nIn short: If you like FPS, Multiplayer(Not any singlerplayer choice here) and WW1 this is the game for you.\nPros and cons.\nPros\n+Authentic and well balanced.\n+Teamplay encouraged and often used.\n+Frequent updates and fixes.\nCons\n-Glitchy and bugs (Game is in Beta)", u'hours': 232.0, u'date': u'2014-10-29', u'early_access': true, u'user_id': u'76561198025310676', u'product_id': u'242860', u'page_order': 2, u'products': 157, u'page': 1435}

Even for some of the routes, the events through the happy ending could make a grown man cry. Usually, an otoge would also have quite a predictable storyline, and in this case, there were some elements that were expected, but there were also so many twists that just slapped me across the face with no warning what so ever. At the same time, looking back, those twists were tied together nicely with the premise before.\nThere were, however, flaws in the composition of the story. The pace sometimes felt a bit too fast, or sometimes it felt like they were including unecessary scenes (honestly, there was way to much time spent on exagerating how the MC is a nice, merciful human). The flow didn't feel as comfortable as it would with something like a good anime. It's not the pinnacle of storytelling, but they did do quite well.\nThe characters (ahem- apart from Enju-) are well developed and extremely human. I honestly would pay for a DLC or sth with Kyara and Ieyasu as playable routes. There is well-timed humour, which is genuinely funny and endearing at the same time. The OST pulls together the mood nicely, and the voice acting is on. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing. point. Especially Hanzo's. (tho the downside is that I couldn't bear to skip the dialogue like usually do just to hear the 10/10 voice acting). And you can probably see how beautiful the art is from the images on steam- it's consistantly high quality in game.\nAlthough, I have to say, the heroine can sometimes be extremely infuriating- she does have her times when she pulls through and is strong, but for alot of the storyline she cowers and has a weak personality which is really stereotypical for an otoge heroine. That was a bit irritating imo.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 2}

The stun->soul-> soul break-> mystic arte system makes it simple to just spam the same abilities over again but with the abundance of skills, i never really found it boring.\nI think the flow of the game- introduction of characters, skills, game mechanics and all and everything- was integrated beautifully.\nThe skits were amazing and well composed- adding the light hearted humour while incorporating the backstories of each character, and building the storyline thats played on.\nThe story is probably the most engrossing thing that ive played/watched for months. Even after finishing the game and clearing most of the side stories, i want more closure.

Warface Dollars can be used to purchase certain weapons and items for the player\'s classes, while Vendor points contribute toward unlocking new items for purchase in one of three categories: Weapons, Outfits, and Equipment. Booster packs are available for sale in the in-game store, allowing the player to earn additional XP, $, and VP.\nThe game features four different classes: Rifleman, Medic, Engineer, and Sniper.

The scenery in the game is awesome and gives the player a real oldskool WW1 feeling. The bad thing is, the game is not even close to a complete game that is finished and optimalized for you. Rigth now the game is a bit laggy, the class setup is a bit weird and sometimes the map are so buggy. But that is right now, i can imagine after they have fixed the problems the game will be so awesome.

Think of bombcraters, barbed wire blown away, sandbags and other cover destroyed.\n- More weapons, plz more weapons\n- Other way for class setup, it's a bit indistinct or it is just me\n- Make some weapons less powerful, like the MG is OP (i can now :P, i like it but i can understand that some players don't). i dont if i like the instakill on all rifles. It is almost chanceless to attack the enemy but if you defend it is easy if you hit them.\n- New gamemodes, let them be tactical.

I've never played the BG series that a lot of people seem to compare this game to so I might just not be a fan of this game style.\nI could never bring myself to go pass the 2nd town in the 12.6 hours I've played. Most of the time I just ran around talking to npcs and completing quests/side quests that were pretty boring to me as some of them just involved running around town talking to people. Controlling 2 people in single player also breaks the immersion of roleplay. Arguing with myself (because we have 2 main characters for some reason in singleplayer) turned it into a what-I-wanted-for-characteristics grind using this system.\nThe combat and exploration is pretty much the same throughout the entire first zone. I don't see it hinting that the combat is gonna get more strategic or synergetic between characters outside of what I started with (aka tank and spank with CC's thrown in there that you start out with). The exploration involved opening a bunch of containers...many many containers and the occasional locked container hoping to find something worth wasting your time over because of RNG making the box empty or containing worthless items... and talking to a bunch of npcs for many hours...\nOverall pretty bland and stale due to the pacing and the lack of sense of progression, and fighting being a minor and also very bland part of the game. The free exploration and being able to pick/steal anything seemed cool at first because it seemed to make the game have a lot of choices of what to do, but that is not true. Maybe if I can bring myself to continue playing this it'll get better, but as of pretty much completing the first town, I wouldn't recommend this game.\nMain points of the game:\n- Picking items up or stealing them (gets pretty boring).\n- Opening a lot of containers in this game is a waste of time but is necessary (without mods) to have items to use/sell.\n- Talk to a bunch of npcs.\n- When you kill something, it doesnt come back (without mods). After you kill mobs in an area once, you basically cannot play with the combat system as there is nothing to fight.\n- The respawning mobs in the mod also make originally friendly npcs not do anything while you kill them over and over and over for items and experience. They also respawn as generic npcs with no functionality other than dying from you breaking your weapon on them over and over.\n- Leveling is slow and very bland (damage and defense bonuses seem to be the strong point over getting new skills to improve strategy and synergy).\n- Seemingly random instant death events if you go to free explore. The only purpose of which is to make you restart the game at the last point you saved and anger you (mine fields, more mine fields, mine field in that grave you're digging, mob that's 7 levels higher than you in that grave that kills your guys in 1 hit, suicidal bomber skeleton in that grave you're digging).", u'early_access': false, u'page': 173}

I would give it an overall 8.5/10. Definitely worth checking out if you're into new styles of gameplay. This one utilizing voice commands.\nStory and Immersion (9/10):\nI liked how there were times where we could respond to the characters in the game to include us into the story, which made me feel more immersed into the story line since I was somewhat more involved in it. In other games, I usually find myself reaching for the skip cutscene button to watch all at once on the internet since I had no reason to care so much about it, espcially if I was just after good gameplay. It could have been improved on with choices affecting the game's direction where we could then go back and make different decisions, but I can see that a lot more would have to be developed into the game to make a strong incentive for the player want to go back to play the story again and again. Just including the player themselves right now and waiting for a vocal response was great.\nThe story was overall pretty interesting to see things change and the plot twists happen (don't want to spoil since the story is one of the strong points of the game).\nVoice Commands (10/10) and Gameplay (7.5/10):\nThe voice commands work extremely well (probably the only game where voice commands worked pretty much flawlessly for me). It's also pretty awesome that you can add extra words or intuitively say something similar to the default commands and they'd do just that. Much better than when I yelled FIREBALL FIREBALL PLZ ;-; FIREBAAAALLL in another game and yet nothing happened (it was still in development but don't know whatever happened to that game). They also tell you not to yell in this game if your mic is too loud.\nThe play through the story is pretty cool to see different scenarios and designs of the rooms that we fight in. I feel like some improvements could have been made to the combat or how missions could have been executed. There was, for example, one mission where have to do something stealthily. I think they could've utilized that system a bit more instead of putting players right into firefight combat on most missions. At the moment, it's possible to switch weapons according to the situation and just fire from cover in order to overcome almost all situations.\nI think adding environmental interactive weapons/items/effects and putting more of an emphasis on flanking would have improved the gameplay further. I think it would have also fit the game controls in that the object's name could become a keyword in the voice command.\nOverall a decent gameplay experience although a bit short (maybe for the better unless the combat and loadout progression system was improved upon).\nMusic and Audio (9.5/10):\nAbsolutely loved the music and effects in this game. They fit exactly the atmosphere of what happens at each point in the game and was brought forward enough to notice rather than having to take a step back from the gameplay and then finally hear that there was music in the background (that might be my own problem though). One of those you might find that you want the soundtrack for.\nGame Credits (10/10):\nAbsolutely great how they did the credits. I think it's a stern professional thing to have a cinematic or black screen with music playing while the credits are just rolling up the screen. But they would just be names with no special meaning to me. And, unless the cinematic or music is extremely godly, I always skipped them. Probably the first time I watched the credits from a video game from start to finish. It was great getting to know the faces and personalities of those behind the game.\nAt the end of the day...\nDefinitely a game worth checking out for the story, voice commands, and music. The combat is great at first however, it might not be exciting enough for players after playing for a few hours. But it is very interesting to use voice commands to control the characters in the game the first time you play. A game worth picking up when it is on sale if you are just after the game itself, but definitely worth supporting the people behind the game who are not just random names on the end credits thanks to their presentation at the end.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 22}

Careful whoever apparently reports first directly to support will win the banhammer wars.

Then to have them actually succeed because the guy who checked the ticket is as dumb and worthless as a person as they are backing up someone with the mind of a 5 year old child telling everyone to report with a "he said", "she said".

This has got to have been the most garbage community in an MMO I\'ve played since Archeage.\nRNG upgrading system is garbage after basic armor sets you\'ll spend most of your time afk farming gold just to fail and revert. Combat is the only fun part yet every single server is overcrowded and you\'ll get into endless pvp fights over farming spots that get in the way of farming because karma takes forever to lower and they can just respawn instantly at a nearby node and come back in less than a minute. Most of the time it\'s a single player game since you\'ll be on your own making money to upgrade your gear with no group content aside from node wars. And even group content is AIDs the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out due to the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 community and the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 operators that back them up apparently. Guild members are usually AFK making money and doing something else as well.\nThe base game is 10 dollars but you have to waste time watching loot animation and you\'ll need at least 3 pets to pick up items for you (27 or more dollars) then you have to get weight items or else you\'ll run out of room to pick up items in 15 minutes of farming (20 dollars minimum for okay farming time (35 minutes)). This is the absolute minimum to not have to make half your active gameplay time tinkering with picking up items and getting rid of trash weighing you down. This is if you carry nothing when you go farming. If you want to carry pots, you\'ll have to spend at least another 15 dollars for the weight of the stuff you bring especially with health pots weighing the most yet must be spammed if you get into a pvp fight over a farming spot, which you\'ll lose if you don\'t pot. And the best part is, it\'s character based. If you want to expand weight or inventory on another character, well you better use it only for fighting and not looting because you\'ll need to rebuy weight, inventory functional items all over again.\nNow if you want to AFK farm, guess what, bust out that wallet. You\'ll need at least a 22 dollar "costume" in order to process items that actually don\'t make you lose money in the process because they\'ll fill up your weight in less than 20 minutes. Also you\'ll want to max your weight in order to at least process for 5 hours. 20 minutes afk making money vs 5 hours hmmmm. I was thinking of giving this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665a try for another 1 or 2 weeks but having a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665tard get me banned after he started typing\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing with me first and having the game\'s \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 team ban me...I don\'t mind giving up a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665game when I should be enjoying it after work.\nBy the way I afk\'d probably 520 of those hours I\'ve played farming simulator. And I regret spending 50 dollars thinking to myself that full price might be worth for the game because the combat was fun without getting further.\nBetween the community and the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing stupid workers behind the game, I wonder why I tried picking up an MMO again, especially one heavily compared to Archeage, after I stopped playing games after a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 experience in Archeage.', u'hours': 983.4, u'date': u'2017-10-12', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 2, u'product_id': u'582660', u'page_order': 5, u'products': 345, u'page': 166}

,{u'username': u"'BoA' Contrafirm", u'text': u"Spoiler-Free Review\nThief: Deadly Shadows was a game that I went into with high standards but low expectations. I loved the first two Thief games. The third I expected to be consolized, watered-down experience that wouldn't do the series justice.\nI'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised, and as the game went on, familiarly exhilarated. Everything I loved about Thief was intact. The mechanics are smooth, the AI is just as familiar. The oppressive, dark atmosphere still hangs over all locales. The graphics liven up the settings, as well as the inhabitants of the City. The stylized cut-scenes are again present, the story fits the series lore, and even many sound effects are taken from the other Thief games.\nWhat I was most impressed with, however, was how the game still controlled like the first two games. The Dark Engine used for the first two games is a beautiful, wonky, archaic, one-of-a-kind engine. Thief 1 and 2, and System Shock 2 as well, have a distinct control and floatiness to them. I thought the simple fact that Thief: Deadly Shadows wouldn't be using the Dark Engine would massively take away from what made playing Thief feel like playing Thief. But to my surprise, Thief: Deadly Shadows runs on the only engine that rivals the Dark Engine's wonkiness: Unreal Engine 2.\nUnreal 2 is the only engine in 2004 that would've been capable of preserving the feel of Thief. Those Havok physics that don't quite make sense, leaving everything a tad slow and floaty, end up perfectly, if even unintentionally, preserving Thief's feel perfectly. I loved it.\nThere are a few new features in Thief: Deadly Shadows. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are items old and new. The world sits more like a hub, with places to sell stolen loot and buy items and arrows between missions. While some may find the hub hard to get used to, I ended up likening the hub to its own mission, familiar and simple, between the more unique missions in other locations. The last big feature worth mentioning is the third-person view. It is a toggle and completely ignorable for the purists, but I found it unintrusive and useful. I preferred to play in first-person the way that I was used to, but being able to look around corners, get better views, and even just ground Garrett in the world around him I found very enjoyable. To be able to see Garrett in more than just cut-scenes helped me more connect with the character as he mumbled his comments throughout the gameplay.\nAltogether, this game is a very worthy entry in the series. It upholds all that makes Thief great, and successfully makes the experience fresh. I recommend it to all Thief fans. If you've never played any Thief games, I highly, highly suggest starting the series chronologically. While I believe you'd still appreciate the game without playing the first two, Thief: Deadly Shadows is in fact the third game in the original Thief trilogy. The game treats itself that way as well. The game, in form, mechanics, and especially story, is very noticeably built atop its predecessors, and it should be appreciated that way.\nHappy Playing.", u'hours': 26.2, u'date': u'2017-06-30', u'early_access': false, u'user_id': u'76561198081560544', u'product_id': u'6980', u'page_order': 9, u'products': 96, u'page': 7}

,{u'username': u"'BoA' Contrafirm", u'text': u"They don't make games like this anymore. I bought this game because it is a classic in the same way as System Shock 2 and Deus Ex. Two games I also like. Yes, this game is old. I had to find a mod on google to play the game in widescreen. Character models are hilariously lumpy. Textures look grainy if you get too close to them. If you insist on having state-of-the-art graphics (that your computer can't even fully run) in your games, then you will hate Thief Gold.\nHowever, if you can tolerate the graphics, you will find that they actually enhance the feel of the game. It's a unique feeling to see a new kind of enemy and still have no idea what it is after its killed you more than five times. The shadows and lighting are primitive, but if you are playing a stealth game and need you hide in the shadows, you should be glad that the shadows are so dark and clean-cut.\nGameplay is very fine. No other game encourages stealth by giving you a combat tutorial that shows how broken the combat actually is. If you were like me, you'll play the first few missions way too aggressively and end up being chased by soldiers everywhere the whole time. As the game gets harder though, and you stand even a smaller chance against each enemy, you'll be able to use the sneaking mechanics the right way.\nWhat you will be able to quickly recognize in the game is how much it doesn't explain. Just google what each type of arrow does and you'll thank me. The only other things that could be frustrating are the mission objectives. If you've played Goldeneye 007 you should understand. Some objectives are so vague that you must just explore the whole level until something happens.\nExploring levels is very enjoyable though. Each level is different in setting and theme. There are mansions, caverns, streets, tombs, towers, etc. Level design seems very simple at first, but the later levels get more complex, I think at times rivaling the GoldSource Engine in complexity.\nMost levels are either sneaking past guards and getting loot, or exploring monster-infested caves for plot items. Both are enjoyable. The sneaking ones are generally more involved but more frustrating. I think there is a nice balance.\nOverall, the game is surprisingly enjoyable. If you can appreciate older games, give it a go. If you are worried that it won't hold up as good as you remember when you last played it ten years ago, give it a go.\nThe game is not the greatest compared to everything else out there, but its high status is deserved as Thief Gold is a gem of FPS history that went on to inspire every other FPS after it.", u'hours': 19.3, u'date': u'2014-12-31', u'early_access': false, u'user_id': u'76561198081560544', u'product_id': u'211600', u'page_order': 4, u'products': 96, u'page': 64}

Great game mechanics both inside and outside combat, quests are the best i have seen in a game in a long time, involving detective work, puzzle solving, diplomacy and combat in equal measure. Character building is suprisingly deep and 'old school' more akin to paper table top games than anything in modern RPGs.\nCo-op is incredible, many key dialogue points involve both players and if they disagree on the option that chould be chosen, an argument using a rock sicssor paper system  linked with intimdate, charm and reasoning stats is used. This allows the winner to force certain solutions. Want to see the 'renegade' end to this quest but the other player likes to be the white knight? well you can intimidate him into backing down! As well as this many spells and skills across characters can combo together, both outside and inside of combat. Entirely possible for one character to soak an enemy with a water debuff, jsut before hte other blasts him with lightning or ice magic. Or one player cna keep an NPC talking while his teammate lockpicks the the chest behind him.\nOverall story is decent so far (im about 10 hours in), its reminiscent of warcraft 3 with a series of interlinked stories, with a generally serious overtone but with zaney characters and humour tastfully interjected in a way that makes you smile rather than cringe.\nTL;DR = If you like cRPGs you will like this. If you like modern RPGs like Mass effect or Dragon Age you will probably like this, though you may be uspet you cant screw any young assasin boys or blue women.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 424}

,{u'username': u"'Dr.Gustavo", u'text': u'There\u2019s a kind of poetic irony in remaking a game designed to poke fun at the game industry, considering all the remakes and reboots already flooding shelves. To both its credit and detriment, Re;Birth1 carries that identity struggle throughout.\n\nSometimes the in-jokes and references are spot on, while others fail to critique and instead repeat old mistakes. What could have been a new start for the series instead becomes a merely average role-playing game that just doesn\u2019t fit together completely.\nIt\u2019s lighthearted, and sports some fun, giant-anime-weapon battles, but its lack of challenge causes it to grow stale quickly.\nThe best part of the Hyperdimension Neptunia games is inarguably the concept: Four goddesses, each representing a different game system, are waging a \u201cConsole War\u201d against one another in a cutesy, high-octane anime fashion.\nFollowing this idea, Re;Birth1 is filled with meta, fourth wall-breaking humor, and a good bit of charming self-awareness. Pretty much every character and party member you encounter along the way fits into some sort of anime or gaming archetype \u2014 Neptune, who represents the fourth (imaginary) console, is the high-energy, childlike protagonist, while Iffy is a smart tsundere who can get quite flustered at times \u2014 and Re;Birth1 actually does a good job of balancing character versus caricature. That\'s about where "good balance" ends, however.\nOne cheeky addition along the same self-aware vein is the \u201cremake\u201d system, which changes aspects of dungeons like enemy difficulty and the types of items that appear. It\u2019s good in theory , but in practice, it\u2019s not all that fun to go through old dungeons again just to get new items. I didn\u2019t think grinding was at all necessary, either, so \u201cremaking\u201d a dungeon to increase the challenge didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\nGrinding is made unnecessary, by the way, due to the relative ease of combat. It\u2019s of the basic turn-based, open-movement variety, and I found it functional, yet underwhelming.\nThe only strategy I really needed was to have my healer heal between attacks and kind of brute force my way through things, though a few harder fights were more satisfying. A partnering system that allows one party member to loan her battle perks to another while staying out of harm\u2019s way adds another dimension to battle, but it\u2019s not really necessary, and ultimately, it just made battles easier, not more exciting.\nThe story and dialogue both suffer from the same identity problems that permeate every other aspect of Re;Birth1, being simultaneously irritating and endearing at times. If a monster was clearly too hard for the area, I realized it before the characters sassily pointed it out, and I don\u2019t need a dozen mentions of the word \u201ctsundere\u201d to realize which characters fit the archetype. Again, the ideas were there, but they were either too shallow or too frequent, rendering them moot. But I also found it adorable and loved playing as a group of dorky girls, at least for a while.', u'hours': 11.9, u'date': u'2016-06-23', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'product_id': u'282900', u'page_order': 6, u'products': 106, u'page': 154}

For this game will bring your desires. This game is strictly strategy with no story and or campaign. Everything starts as a set-up senario where you choose allies, vicctory options, and how fast you want the resource to be given to you.\nRebellion has only a few noticeable differences to Trinity. Graphics is more improved as the game is using a better graphic engine. Another differences I\'ve spotted is AI are responding very well. They are a challenge to fight against.\nThis game a lot can be seen as a cinematic space-combat simulation. Ever wonder what Star Wars would be like with you being able to control the camera? Well you can fully see the entire battle as if you were in SPACE, without the "cannot breath" thing. You can a lot follow ships by zooming into the ship, then the camera will follow where ever it goes. More fun when u zoom in tiny units like bombers or fighters. Great for someone who would like to make a movie.\nRegardless, this game will get repetitive, It\'s addicting but it is repetitive. When you dwell into it, you see a lot of options and a lot of things you can do. Sooner or later, you\'ll be taking the same step over and over as each game starts. Upgrading are pretty fun too. Discovering what each race have and their advantages along with disadvantages to exploit.\nThis game is WORTH it if it is on sale. It is a stand-alone so you do not need Trinity to play this. Have fun in space, fair warning, there will be tons and tons of debris. Space combat is never not-boring to watch. Unless you are losing the battle, of course.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 504}

To aid your efforts, you have access to a growing roster of heroes, each with their own weapons, skills and equipment. Week after week, you send your merry band forth, purging evil one step at a time.\nExcept not quite.\nThe miscreants and monstrosities that have taken up residence in your ancestor\'s estate are no pushovers, and while your first adventure or two might instill the thought that you are the righteous flame, it becomes very clear, very quickly, that you and your roster are but moths to be scorched.\nEnemies are vicious and unrelenting, and facing such fierce and unnatural power takes its toll on your "heroes" - each already battered and broken by the time they arrive at the godforsaken hamlet you\'re tasked to protect. Stress and the human psyche are crucial factors, and the conventional management of loot and stats takes a back seat to simply not having your characters lose their minds during the course of an adventure, lest they lose all reason, abandon hope, or turn on their companions out of rage or paranoia.\nThrough narrow successes and triumphs, the game builds up your fondness towards your roster, only to shatter it in an instant. After all, as Darkest Dungeon reminds you every time you open it: heroes will die, and when they do, they stay dead. After a while, most players grow detached of their heroes, with the exception of a few favourites, perhaps, viewing them all as meat for the grinder, a means to an uncertain end.\nAny review of Darkest Dungeon would be remiss not to mention the gorgeous aesthetic or the gravelly, rumbling tones of its narrator, without which the game would lose much of its gravitas. The narration underscores every victory and every defeat, and through several subtle comments and adjustments, truly brings the nightmarish world to life.\nYou will laugh, you will swear, you will say "\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this, I\'m done" at least once.\nAbsolutely worth it.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 73}

Unlike some of the Dynasty Warrior games, where you can combine light and heavy attacks to do a variety of different combos, this game has almost no variety in that regard.\nThe one interesting mechanic is the transformation. Transformations heal you and allow you to use your special moves, but you can only transform once per fight. It's an interesting little bit of resource management that I really liked.\nAnother positive point is the soundtrack. It has a bunch of rock remixes of classical music. I love it.\nOn the sexual nature of the game: I'm no prude, but it's a little excessive. I was very pleased to find that there were many different costumes to unlock, but I was a bit disappointed when I found out that ALL of it is geared towards various fetishes. Its very limitng, and makes the wide variety of costumes actually fairly boring. Very few of the costumes look nice outside of their sexual appeal. Even then, most of the costumes aren't really all that sexy, in my opinion. I'd be all for sexy girlfs fighting in sexy outfits. I just don't think this game does a very good job of it.\nOn the plus side, some of the girls default costumes look great. Yumi and Hikage's outfits are very sexy and cool, and I love Asuka's Strider-esque scarf.\nAlso, I don't think this is outright stated in the game, but the implication I get is that not all the girls are over the age of 18. I didn't know this until after I bought and played the game. It's a bit icky, and really unnecessary. Nothing about the story necessitates the girls being underaged. One of the younger characters is a masochist who begs other characters to beat her. Having a young teenager do something like that is a bit much, I think. I guess it's not HUGE deal, since they're just animated characters. But I know it would bother some people, so I thought it was worth bringing up.\nIf they refine the combat system and improve the costume options, then I could really enjoy this series. For now, though, there are better action games you could be playing, and better booby anime you could be watching.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 28}

My main complaint in regards to mechanics is that some of the upgrades you can aren't worth the effort. I almost never use the magical attacks. On the positive side, the game is divided into stages, but still has that Metroidvania gimmick of going back to where you've been to unlock upgrades. So if you like the idea of a Metroidvania game but always found running across the giant map to be tedious, this is a good game for you.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 31}

Other reviews compare it to Bejeweled, but that's not quite right. You're given a lot more freedom in how you can move the pieces on the board, but you have a limited number of moves overall. It's a different take on the match three type of game, and I really enjoyed it.\nAs dating each woman progresses, you receive pics from each of them. The third pic typically features the woman's breasts. The final date with each woman features a different kind of puzzle. Instead of limited moves, you're trying to make matches as quickly as possible. This is an odd representation of your character having sex with his or her date, and your date can be heard moaning as you make matches.\nThat's about as sexual as the game gets. So, if any of the above would make you feel uncomfortable, you might want to skip this game.\nOtherwise, if you like puzzle games, you'll get a kick out of this one.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 311}

It\'s very difficult to describe, because I\'ve played anything quite like it.\nThe mood of the game reminds me a bit of Gun Grave, and the premise is similar. You\'re in this cyberpunk environment, heavy on the noir vibe the genere sometimes has. You\'re out to get revenge on the people who ruined your life. You travel through the world, slowly learning about it as you meet and take out those who conspired against you.\nThe main character is mute, so the majority of the dialogue comes from the consciousness within your sword. The voice gives you comfort and counsel. Through this method of storytelling, you get a great feel for what the person trapped in the sword meant to the main character. The person in the sword also names all the enemies as they show up, giving them names like "Jerk" and "Creep." It gives the game a unique personality.\nThe gameplay is also unique, so much so that I find it much harder to explain than the story and atmosphere. As said earlier, it\'s turn-based...sort of. Once your energy is charged up, you can pause the game and plan out your moves. Your character will then perform those moves, and you will then have to dodge attacks until your energy recharges. It\'s a little bit like the VATS system in Fallout, in that regard, but that comparison doesn\'t quite do it justice.\nIf you don\'t mind the kind of story where you slowly learn the details, piece by piece, you\'ll probably love this story. I certainly did.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 152}

However, while the visuals are pleasant, the screen is so visually busy that it's hard to keep track of where things are in the room. The room hazards tend to blend in to the background. This means you have to stop and take a moment to take in the whole room. Which would be fine, if the gameplay complimented such a measured approach. But zipping around with your hookshot is so fast and energetic that it implies that the player is supposed to take the opposite approach. The level design and the gameplay are at odds with each other.\nAdditionally, this game's idea of increasing the difficulty is to cram as many enemies and environmental hazards into the area as possible. And the difficulty spike after the first segment is absurd.\nThe aforementioned enemies also have unpredictable ways of interacting with the environment. For some reason, enemies can pass right through barriers that your character bounces off of. I only found this out after playing the game for two hours, even though the barriers have been there since the begining. Similarly, it's really unclear which part of the floor can be shot through. I've often found what I thought was a safe spot to avoid getting hit by enemy fire, only to get shot by a bullet passing through floors, and then being unable to return fire because my bullets couldn't pass through the same floor.\nThe hook mechanic is unique and easy to learn. I still like the novelty of it, but I don't think the game uses the mechanic to its full potential. I would have enjoyed this game more with less combat and more navigating areas using the hook.\nYou might be more forgiving of the game's faults if you're into games like Sonic the Hedgehog, which has a similar contrast of fast movement and measured platforming. This might be true if you're a retro gamer, in general. This game is styled after retro platformers from Nintendo and Sega, and it comes with many of the benefits and problems those games had. For me, this game didn't do enough to improve the formula. It's a retro game, warts and all.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 15}

I noticed no real imput lag on any of the actions. The jump in every platforming game (5 out of the 6) was highly responsive. I never had a single "I swear I pressed jump" moment like I so often have with these retro games. All of the games are also enhanced with a rewind feature. Since early Capcom games relied a lot on trial and error and pattern recognition, it\'s really nice to have a way to learn what I need to know for a certain section of the game, and not have to deal with limited lives and continues.\nDuckTales and DuckTales 2 have you selecting stages in a fashion similar to MegaMan. You select a stage, get to the end, and fight the boss. DuckTales 2 complicates things a little in that you need to collect map pieces along the way, but othewise the two games are very similar.\nChip and Dale\'s Rescue Rangers 1 and 2 are the only games on the list that I played when I was a little kid. They\'re mostly how I remember them. You go through the levels, and your only method of attack is picking up small cubes and tossing them at your enemies. Once you learn certain tricks, it becomes pretty easy. It has co-op, and it\'s a good game to play with the little kids in your family.\nDarkwing Duck is a MegaMan game. Seriously, the titular superhero uses a gun that is literally just the Mega Blaster, shooting up to three little dots at a time. It feels like Capcom just told the MegaMan development team "Hey, make another MegaMan game, but re-skin it with this American cartoon." This isn\'t a bad thing, for most people. I\'m not very good at MegaMan, but, I could still recognize the quality in this game. It\'s a well designed game, but considerably more difficult than DuckTales and Chip and Dale\'s.\nTailspin is the hardest game of the bunch. It\'s a side-scrolling shoot \'em up, which were often some of the toughest games on the NES. You have to think pretty far ahead to keep your plane from ending up in a position where there\'s no escape. Tailspin certainly isn\'t the hardest of the genre, but it\'s definitely the most challenging game in the collection.\nAll of the games come with boss rush and time attack. You can even watch other players play through these modes, if you\'re the kind of person who enjoys watching speed-runs.\nThese games were already amazing for their time, and this collection has added wonderful enhancements. If you have any interest in a good platformer, I highly recommend getting this game.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 6}

,{u'username': u"'Lil Screm", u'text': u'Dam, what a fantastic as game. I love stealth games, and this is by far the best i have come across. Its so far ahead in its genre and is beautifully thought out. This stealth game actually requires you to spend 5-10 minutes analyzing the surroundings, guard patrol and planning out a route before you get started, and just as you think you have the right route BAM, something that you didnt see pops out, requiring you to think on your feet. The side missions and playstyle bonus add a nice touch to the game, requiring you to enhance your sneak capability in order to pass without setting off any alarms, increase your duel ability by killing everyone and even expand your perception as you hunt for relics and coins. All in all a fantastic game, one i recommend highly to other stealth lovers and also to anyone wanting to pick up a beautiful game.\n10/10 would drop chandeliers on people :D', u'hours': 27.4, u'date': u'2017-02-25', u'early_access': false, u'user_id': u'76561198054148366', u'product_id': u'242640', u'page_order': 8, u'products': 26, u'page': 52}

It is another type of game similar to Day Z but set with demonic enemies. Starting out is a bit tricky but you get the hang of it soon. The graphics are pretty good for a BETA and i just absolutly love this game. If anyone is having trouble with their game, contact me and ill help you cause i went through the troubles and not one of the guides work.

,{u'username': u"'Nader Bob", u'text': u'This one\'s a tad difficult to review.\nGnomoria\'s a bit of a mixed bag. While it was released feature complete, it also has some leftover, possibly gamebreaking bugs. So no matter how stupid this whole !ABANDONED! !FINISHED! argument going on in the reviews might seem, both sides are right ... in a way. Lemme put it this way - the game\'s "done". But it\'s not technically dead, look up tacyn\'s mod in the workshop, it adds a crapton of stuff like new enemies, plants, trees, resources, craftable items and equipment, decorations and work stations. It\'s easy to install and also lets you pick from multiple options regarding all of the changes like trade overhaul, smelting and technological progress.\nI\'d probably be more annoyed by this whole situation if I didn\'t get it on a 3$ sale some years ago, while it was still in very early access. It looked promising and in the end - I don\'t feel cheated. Throughout the EA, Robo did iron out the bugs and solved the issues in a pretty swift manner, while also adding some features and options requested by the players. A lot of issues and negativity were created when he released a "roadmap", that wasn\'t really a roadmap. It was just a list of things that he would like to eventually add into the game, more like a memo or a wishlist of sorts rather than a set-in-stone development plan. It was pretty quickly removed and if I recall correctly, never properly explained, so in a convoluted way - misunderstandings are perfectly understandable. Also, Robo\'s departure from the project was handled very poorly, and while I can totally understand WHY he did it, he created a lot of hostility and if he ever comes back from the dead to make another game - it\'ll come back to bite him in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 big time.\nBut enough of that, let\'s talk about the game itself.\nGnomoria\'s a DF inspired sandbox strategy/city builder that has thrown away the epic size and depth in favor of accessibility and graphics (though to be fair, DF\'s not as deep as some people would claim). The scale\'s much smaller, the game\'s more focused and streamlined and the mouse controls are supported by the ability to use rebindable keyboard hotkeys, so it controls just fine.\nOnce you\'re thrown into the main menu, I recommend checking the audio settings first, where you get to choose between the 2 versions of the soundtrack - the oldschool 8-bit and a typical, "orchestral" version.\nAfter that you should probably try and start a new game, where you\'ll get to create a game world first. You can choose the world seed, the general shape of the landscape, change the difficulty settings and select the mods you\'re going to use. You can also preview a small, central chunk of the area soon-to-be-generated. First of all - deselect the goblin tunnelers and the beetles, that single step solves 90% of the issues you\'ll have with the game. All the underground mobs have weird spawn rules, which wouldn\'t be a problem if not for the fact that beetles can multiply, so if you don\'t know how to handle them (and they\'re one of the stronger mobs) or are unaware of any nearby caverns, after a few in-game years you\'ll notice the fps drops and if you won\'t handle them there and then - eventually the game will feel more like a slideshow and eventually your save will become unplayable. Goblin tunnelers are less obvious, but equally unpleasant to deal with, since the tunnels they create can sometimes (not always) become corrupted and will lead to crashes or broken game tiles. So you deselect those suckers and *BAM!* your game experience is so much better now.\nSo now you\'ve generated your map and finally you\'re there, on the first day of summer at 7:22 in the morning, looking at a small expedition waiting for your orders. You\'re given some basic tools and a few days worth of supplies, from here on you\'re on your own. Not much to say here, it\'s the meat of the game and it works perfectly fine ... well, almost. You might have some problems with the military gnomes, sometimes they act erratically, either ignoring the training sessions they\'re supposed to attend, getting stuck next to a wall and eventually dying of thirst or not equipping the gear assigned to them. What worked for me 100% of the time - select the training grounds, clear all the squads from the schedule, save the game, go back to the main menu and reload the save, assing the squads back and all will be fine. It\'s an annoying 1 minute of "work" every X-number of hours, but hey, at least it\'s fixable. Also, miners and woodcutters make poor soldiers, since they will attempt to use their tools as weapons roughly 50% of the time. This one\'s a bit harder to work around, but luckily, even when not as good as proper weapons, the tools still benefit from better metals used in crafting (only for combat, copper axe will cut trees at the same speed as the iron one would) and their damage types are good, so it\'s not as big of a problem as it could\'ve been. People mention multiple different issues, but those already mentioned in the review are all I\'ve ever encountered.\nI didn\'t really talk a lot about the basic gameplay itself, but lemme put it this way - if you know DF, you already know what you\'re getting, and if you don\'t - think Minecraft with isometric view and lack of direct control, you give orders and stuff gets done.\nYou start small, with bare minimum of resources and couple of gnomes, already assigned to some basic professions. You gather resources from the map to create workshops. Workshops are your crafting centers, you\'ll need \'em to make tools and equipment, create more filling meals, access advanced resources etc., you can also easily automate the majority of the production as long as you can keep the unrefined resources flowing. The whole world is block based and other than the workshops - there are no prefabricates, you\'ll have to create stuff from the grounds up, one block at a time. You\'ll also have to dig down, to get to more valuable ores to forge better weapons and armors. In the meantime you\'ll be attacked by goblins and some other hostile creatures. Everything you craft and build will directly influence your Kingdom Worth, which will also impact the strength of enemy attacks and the amount of gnomads that\'ll join your kingdom each season. Speaking of which - there are 4, no tileset changes, but nothing grows during winter. Lack of tutorial doesn\'t help too much, but the game\'s quite straightforward anyway, just apply common sense and when in doubt - mouse over the "?" buttons present within every workshop and building menu.\nOther than that, I\'ve only crashed once, and that was back in the early access and was caused by a known and now fixed issue, so ... not bad, not bad at all.\nNow if you excuse me, I\'ve a kingdom to run.

The AI pathing is shoddy at times, for some reason only one character can interact with certain paths at a time. It's a minor problem, but it hurts the immersion.\n2. There are a lot of little things in the game you can notice, but the dialogue and plot push you to look past them. Again, a minor issue, but it feels like the devs want you to interact with everything and find the little hidden things and then the plot contradicts that.\n3. The cool thing about the dialogue is that the options can interrupt NPC dialogue, it's a great idea, but as with most inventive ideas in the gaming industry, it's not executed perfectly. Occasionally, you will be forced to choose a dialogue option due to a time limit, even though you want to keep listening to the NPC's, or you'll press a dialogue option before an NPC starts speaking and you'll miss out that way. Good idea, decent execution. Again, only a minor detractor.\nEssentially, this is a really good story driven game. It's somewhat short, but has replayability through its branching story.

And i like the progress the game did in the last two years.\nBut: The most features didn\xb4t work for me anymore. I also didnt have the chance to enjoy the beautiful Unity5/DirectX12 landscape and engine effects because i can only go out at specific daytimes. I can\xb4t enjoy all the wonderful designed community-/ social features. And here is the reason why:\nI have a\n.\nI know this sounds stupid, and i know the size doesn\xb4t matter. But after you implemented female characters it gets harder to me. Harder in relation to the way to play.. No one wants to interact with me anymore after i dropped my pants.\nBefore this all of my male friends ignored this handicap because we were bonded by blood and a magic rock. During this time I could compensating this flaw by playing the guitar around the campfire together with my friends.\nYesterday a woman called\npunched me after i dropped my pants and her baritone voice asked me if my "Leopold Alexander" (yes, thats\nname) is a Unity5 engine bug or bad joke from the devs. She left me wounded while she jumped away like a beautiful unicorn.\n*disclaimer:\n\nNow i\xb4m alone in my shelter. No One left. All the new females are running around naked - all my old mates are running around naked too. I\xb4m the only one with pants. And i wont run anymore. I didnt get any haptic feedback of my dong. It feels like nothing. It feels like phantom pain.\nEven the mosaic censorship reveals my dilemma.\nSo here is my request:\nPlease give or normal dong - or a bigger one. You could also try to make it smaller but i cant imagine that your engine can scale it smaller then it currently is. The thingy i currently have feels wrong. Its an physical issue. I have the feeling that i loose my balance because of this. Running, jumping and even walking feels bad nowadays.\nSecond option: Please give me a new Charakter. If this is a woman, Please give me normal boobies - Neither big nor tiny ones and please a bit symetric.\nThird Option: Please add an dongerenlargement tool which really works.

,{u'username': u"'Ol Whiskey Dick", u'text': u'This game has great ideas. Great story, great layout. Great gameplay...however\nThere are a few things that make me want to throw the damn keyboard rhrough the monitor.\nThe autosave feature. I can\'t stand it. I like to be able to quick save what i want. Quick load when I want. Or if you screw up and get yourself killed, RIGHT AWAY it saves and you\'re screwed.\nAlso the fact that you NEED a gun to kill zombies through a boarded window. Let be real, you can still realistically atleast stab them though it. So my point is is that you need to use up precious ammo if you don\'t want a room full of zeds.\nThey couldve done a better job on the vehicles. Sorry but if I had a pickup truck, I could go around town all damn night smashing into plowing into people and the truck would still be kicking.\nBottom line, its a great, fun game. It can be a even better game with some minor changes, that\'s all. The way it is now I\'d give it 3/5 stars. With the minor changes I can comfortably give it 4.5/5 stars hands down just because it\'s alot of fun.  There\'s a program I just downloaded called State of Decay Save Manager to help leviate some of my frustration with the autosave feature. The program pretty much lets you save "checkpoints" throughout the game, and has a quick save/load feature. We\'ll see how it goes.\nHope this review helps some people.

Now, when I play it, I still enjoy it really much.\nIt contains a campaign with about ~40 missions, 4 fast-battle maps and a multiplayer mode, so it will give you at least 10 hours of great gaming. Totally worth that price.\nAlso the soundtracks are awzum - while shooting all the enemies, you\'ll listen to "nightclub-great tracks" :3\nWould recommend, 10/10, even 13 years after release.\n1) Since Multiplayer servers were provided by GameSpy, there is no chance for multiplayer gaming after GameSpy has been deleted. So if you want to play on Multi, the only option would be through a VPN client with friends through LAN mode.\n2) Some of you may have trouble with movement. I don\'t know why, but with optical mouses it\'s sometimes very hard to look around. Lowering your sensitivity helps you a bit, but if it still too annoying for you then the best solution is to play either with controller or oldstyled mouse (that ones with a ball inside instead of a sensor, I don\'t know how this is called)\n3) If anybody else got addicted to game music as much as me, look in YouTube for "PVCF" - all soundtracks would be listed there - HYYYYYPE /o/\nEnjoy the game ^^', u'early_access': false, u'page': 8}

I wish there was an option to give a neutral review rather than just "recommended/not recommended".\nThe visuals and music are decent; not exceptional, but they work. However, there seems to be no way to skip dialogue you have already read, which is frustrating when doing multiple playthroughs or simply trying again after getting a bad end.\nThe story, while it has some surprises and good flow, especially when the pieces of the puzzle finally start to fall together, is sadly not very original. The writing is not bad, but nothing to write home about.\nNow, for the gameplay.\nThe game is a mix of a classic mystery VN with choices influencing the story\'s direction and a "raising sim" which gives you the choice between three different statistics to raise, not unlike an RPG. I had never played such a game before, and was disappointed that X-Note does not make those elements work very well. Rather than influencing the path the story takes, the skills mechanic only seems to serve as milestones you absolutely have to reach before a certain point in the story, or else it\'s game over.\nAt least the game gives you pointers so that you can avoid doing the same mistakes over and over again without knowing what was wrong.\nThere are also a couple minigames thrown inside, but they aren\'t very interesting, and some tend to be frustrating.\nBut X-Note\'s biggest flaw lies in its pricetag; 20 dollars/euros for such a short VN is a hefty one, and the main reason I cannot in good faith recommend this game.\nAt the time of writing this, there seems to be a bug with its pricing; no pricetag is shown, and people have reported simply not being able to buy the game.', u'hours': 7.9, u'date': u'2015-12-20', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'user_id': u'76561198004599764', u'product_id': u'337940', u'page_order': 6, u'products': 130, u'page': 2}

Makes no sense to me.\nI played the Melee character in the tutorial (just hit E twice to finish these battles btw) and then tried the shotgun-wielding char in the one match me and a friend played.\nThe melee char is alright I guess, his skills are a bit OP on Normal but that\'s fine I guess. The shotgun though doesn\'t really work, first of all, he doesn\'t have anything on RMB, why? Secondly I had no idea what his skills did, "Q" throws a grenade I learned at the end of the match (it just seemed like he did a weird sweep and not a throw) but it does NO damage (!) to enemies for some reason. "E" wasn\'t self-explanatory either but I finally realised it sped up your attack speed and no need to reload.\nI haven\'t tried the third class and we\'ll see if I will, uninstalled the game and will wait for updates to the game before I try again.\nI know it\'s early access but playing with a friend from Israel caused waaaay too many issues (I at least assume it was weird lag and not the game but I could be wrong) enemies blinked out of existence, when he placed a barricade "tower" an enemy attacked it with his huge club and they got turned around for some weird reason. I picked up archers and placed them down, 3 out of 4 didn\'t attack.\nBut yeah, main issue I have with the game at this moment is weird animations by enemies, the weird (to me) reasoning to just randomly have towers on the map that you can pick up and place, and we didn\'t find a max either, we placed soooo many and they kept spawning in more and more of them). And lastly the way enemies disappeared when you got close to them to then reappear right in front of you again when you look around for them after your failed attack.\nGonna add a review from YT as well, he says pretty much the same as me:', u'hours': 0.3, u'date': u'2017-06-08', u'early_access': true, u'user_id': u'76561198002270949', u'product_id': u'628710', u'page_order': 4, u'compensation': u'Product received for free', u'products': 1302, u'page': 3}

The fact that its still not launched, and the updates they\'ve pushed out are mediocer at best - I mean, Where\'s Multiplayer? It seems to have dropped off the chart completely from what they originally promised.

I\'ve seen a lot has happened with the story mode. Thats a good improvement. But its not 3 years worth of improvement if you ask me.\nThe gameplay is still the same. Road Rash Esque, Definitely a blast to the past. But it just doesn;t feel completed. Its short, its lack of content, long barren rubber bandy roadways(drivers just appear back on your tail) Its just not polished.\nThey say they\';re about to launch, but I think thats just code for "Im done, here\'s your game you paid for I didn\'t want to finalize!"\nSo, Thats why I was rather disapointed. That and the promise of Multiplayer seeminly has vanished from the game\'s menus, which utterly was the only reason I wanted this game to begin with\nSo, if youd\' like a short fun Road-Rashy game, Yeah.

,{u'username': u"'U'", u'text': u"I've played Wildstar for about a year now, and it's still one of the best games I've played. It's got just about everything you could ask from a MMORPG, and a whole lot more. Memorable characters, exotic places, and even more to make the experience more amazing.\nThere's a boatload of things you can create and customize, each with your own little flare. The character customization is spot on, and gives you a good understanding of what your class and path will allow you to do, even before you take your first steps on the planet Nexus. And even after you get settled in, you'll find that you can make just about anything- from your outfit to your own housing lot- specialized to fit your liking.\nWildstar is just filled with lore, making it a great game to spend time on trying to figure out what's going on behind the calm atmosphere of Nexus. And with 2 sides to choose from, it just opens up mystery and excitement if you're into stuff like that. And no matter what class and path you pick, you'll still be following the story, although the Scientist path really allows you to see the core of what's going on. Every mission brings up questions, and there's great load of collectables and 'Datacubes' that allow you to take a peek into the story even more.\nThe planet Nexus is just filled with amazing and awesome places to explore. Snowy wastelands, lush jungles, even abandoned space stations! Each with its own quests and chances for loot, while assuming you are the appropriate level, of course, as most areas are sectioned by your character's level. Both PVE and PVP zones have secrets waiting to be discovered, and the Explorer path can help you reach and discover secret places that only you can find. Even if that's not your style, Nexus is still pretty huge, and you'll often be caught looking in awe at the beautiful- or terrifying- landscape.\nWildstar's combat system and PVP matches are extremely fun and challenging. Even if you don't want to wait for a lobby, there are certain areas on Nexus that are PVP friendly, but you can turn this off if you want to. Back to the bloodshed, though, there's various dungeons and types of PVP matches you can queue in for. PVP matches can include a CTF type mode where you scramble around with your team to capture and defend masks, the ever so original 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 arena mode, and you can even make a huge party and set up a War Plot, then participate in a whopping 40v40 PVP match. Meanwhile, PVE can still satisfy your thirst for blood with interesting enemies and challenging bosses to keep you on your toes. Each class gives you different ways to be effective on your enemies, making teamwork sometimes very essential.\nAll in all, I recommend Wildstar. The community isn't very toxic, there's fun events and challenges, but I HIGHLY recommend that you get a friend or two to play this with you, since the experience is even better with friends.

That's how it's done properly.\n**EDIT APR 23 - Version 1.4**\nSo this morning I'm trying out the new Rocketeer Class, and I go back into the lobby after the round to find the DEVELOPER online answering questions and taking oppinions and feedback. I had made a suggestion in the forum, so I asked about it, and he confirmed that it will be in the next update with some other ideas the community had offered.\nAside from this game being oddly fun, I love that there's a group of people working on this game to make it work how we want, while pushing their own ideas further.\nMy only critique from last time was that I wanted to jump. Now I can jump, but it's bound to the same key as roll. I'm sure it will be fixed, but I lol'd when I was trying to figure out how to roll again.\nIt's not a perfect game by any means, but I still haven't touched my growing backlog of AAA games since getting into Guardians\n**Original Review - Version 1.3**\nI was given this game by a friend for a gaming event, and while I wasn't hooked right away, I kept coming back. Now I'm hooked. I've got 6 AAA games waiting to be played, but I'm having a LOT OF FUN playing Guardians.\nThere are issues with the game, but they're constantly being fixed, so there's not really any point listing them. Other than lack of jumping. I get why, since the game can be played top down, but it's hard to just not jump.\nI'll probably update this later too...", u'hours': 233.6, u'date': u'2016-03-27', u'early_access': true, u'found_funny': 3, u'user_id': u'76561197963335763', u'product_id': u'407840', u'page_order': 0, u'products': 4008, u'page': 198}

My son actually played it, then challenged me to a match. I've got to say its a pretty fun game.\nThe jist of it is that you play tower defense against your opponent while also sending waves of units against them. There is gold from mining and battlepoints from sending units (more BP the longer they last on the map). You need both. Towers and units are bought with gold, upgrades are bought with BP, and units are unlocked with both.\nWhat I find interesting is that you need to balance sending out lots of units to get upgrades, and you need to keep your maze strong to stop enemy units from getting BP for upgrades.\nThe main downside to this game is that there are some fairly predictable setups that will win matches against players that expect a regular TD game. If you find an opponent that uses a similar setup, the game can progress, but otherwise its usually quite one sided.\nOverall, I think its a fun game, with some features that make it different from the rest of the TD out there.", u'hours': 45.3, u'date': u'2014-08-02', u'early_access': false, u'user_id': u'76561197963335763', u'product_id': u'214360', u'page_order': 6, u'products': 4008, u'page': 34}

I think I already complained enough about this but its a huge point.\nThe fighting system and the animations are very very well made, just as in ds 1, so if you are experienced in ds 1 you will also make it easily through dark souls II, there are only a few movement changes and no big changes in the overall fighting system, so it still is awesome in nearly every way.\nFeels like a lot of pointless stuff I mentioned above was added just to make the game longer, because it can be played through very fast if the bosses dont kill you over and over again, but besides all my complaints it makes everything very well.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 730}

If you can't take the most obvious route (because of a locked door for example), all you have to do is look around and you'll find other paths to take, or at least clues of what you are looking for.

It shuffles its pieces around, finds better places for them to fit, and defies the idea that overhauling a flawed experience is absolutely necessary.\nThe result is, of course, a better 2D brawler, the kind most wished it would have been the first time around -- and it'll absolutely turn your Shank crank again.\nShank 2 addresses flaws Klei is acutely aware of, so it practically shouts about how much better it is now than it used to be. Main character Shank dodges with an effortless flick of the right stick, which is a massive step up from the clunky trigger/stick combo from the first game.\nAttacking and healing aren't tied to the same button as they were previously. Where the animation system used to inhibit Shank, it now enables him: He moves faster, pounces farther and higher, and can switch between weapons mid-combo without a split-second delay signing his death certificate. In addition, exclamation marks above enemies' heads act as an instant-death counter-kill indicator, which is massively helpful for plucking particularly troublesome guys from a group. Also, disarming and executing dudes is quick enough not to break your rhythm, but slow enough to glorify the grossness of kicking a baseball bat down someone's throat. Uninterrupted murder is a beautiful blend of graceful fluidity and harsh ferocity, and few melee-centric action games achieve this kind of big-combo bliss.\nThe combat is improved for more than basic input reasons, too. Enemies attack in different ways from various places -- dudes chuck grenades from across the screen, careful shooters take precise pistol aim from above, and maniacal machine-gunners fire bursts in your general direction. Instant-kill pits make short work of bad guys (and you) too, and throwing switches to crush five guys beneath a shipping container is sickening fun. Each encounter is an unpredictable puzzle where evasion, aggression, and an impressive array of acrobatics earn you a personal accomplishment greater than any leaderboard high score.\nJuggling and switching from your quick-attack shanks to a heavy sledgehammer to the shotgun aren't just cool-looking tactics -- they're completely necessary to surviving. By comparison, the first game is slow, unsatisfying, and cumbersome. (Really, you can never go back.) Shank 2 is demanding, and in a 2D action game so reliant on player precision, these simple tweaks make your life a hell of a lot easier.\nEven the most difficult problems in Shank 2 have easy solutions. More importantly, its harshest conditions can't come close to the maddening challenge of its predecessor. This is perhaps the best step forward -- the first Shank had some ridiculously difficult spots. In Shank 2, you'll only bash your head against the occasional brick wall as long as you let it stand. When shotgun blasts or the scythe aren't doing enough damage to certain characters, swapping to the revolver or chainsaw is usually enough to take 'em down. Main character Shank no longer switches weapons on the fly during a level, though, and must instead trade gear between deaths. It's small inconvenience, but knowing weapon properties -- bonus damage against fat enemies or a knock-back effect, for instance -- and changing your strategy accordingly is the key to powering through tougher sections. Boss battles are a particularly great example of these and the rest of Shank's greatest design elements coming together. As bosses are meant to be, they're the final exam for everything you've learned along the way -- if you didn't pick up on and make use of something new and important, you're going to have a tough time with their interesting patterns and brutal attacks.\nCo-op would have made the campaign a cakewalk, which is perhaps the reason it's single-player only this time around. Shank 2 trades the first title's local cooperative campaign for wave-based online multiplayer. It's both a trade-up and a trade-down. Clobbering coordinated bombers before they blow up supply caches for 30 waves involves all the single-player's best Shank-isms -- two players use the terrific combat, mount weapons, and set off traps to eviscerate and burn bad guys -- and requires serious skill. Dying doubles your ally's duties, plus they're responsible for reviving you, so bring a coordinated comrade or suffer the consequences.\nEarning cash for kills to buy mini-guns, turrets, decoys, and, uh, a wild boar gives you a reason to seek out incoming enemies as well, rather than just let your buddy take care of the worst situations. There's an alluring draw to replaying the three maps with new characters, too -- each has his or her own statistics, like health bonuses, item discounts, or damage modifiers, and each match plays out differently based on how you experiment with various pairs. Survival Mode feels thrown in out of obligation rather than inspiration, yet it still brings enough new to the table that it'll melt away an hour in an instant.\nSurvival Mode is probably where most will spend the majority of their time -- Shank 2 is only a couple hours long, and there's little incentive to replay the campaign. Granted, the single-player is flashy, gorgeous, and where the coolest stuff happens, like escaping giant boulders and buzz-saws, fighting through a burning village, or exploring a massive boat with a bunch of diverging paths. Survival Mode is missing distinctive qualities to call its own, so it exists if you feel shortchanged but is inessential if you'd rather move onto the next great game in your library.\nIf there's one major change in Shank 2, it's the tone. Thematically, Shank was absurd. The game was dark and violent, which didn't quite fit in with the Luchadores, strippers, guys in gimp masks occupying each arena. Shank 2 is about martial law, facist oppression, and endangered family. It doesn't do anything to capitalize on this stuff, which is a shame -- the cinematics are still goofy, profane, and senseless, and some of the bosses are a bit out of left field, visually. The grim approach a nice touch to the gameplay, anyway, and fits into the grand scheme of making Shank 2 feel much more in line with itself.", u'hours': 18.2, u'date': u'2014-11-07', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 3, u'product_id': u'102840', u'page_order': 8, u'products': 2323, u'page': 33}
,{u'username': u"'WitteBae \U0001f339", u'text': u'Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn\'t quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.\nClaire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they\'ve found themselves trapped in.\nIn Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you\'ll get at game\'s end, of which there are six of.\nThe gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.\nMonsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can\'t climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don\'t chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won\'t chase you, but getting near it will drain your \'sanity\'.\nSanity isn\'t for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower\'s panic feature, basically. The more loss of \'calm\' and scared you become, the more you\'ll start taking damage, until you\'re panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you\'ve come more familiar with its layout.\nNormally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It\'s going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch\'s House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.\nAnd its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.\nI\'m sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don\'t think this game is worth passing up on for this.\nClaire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.\nIt\'s a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you\'re supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.\nSpeaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and "WTF" moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.\nI might be a bit gushy, but that\'s because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It\'s a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It\'s rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.\nA bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.', u'hours': 22.7, u'date': u'2014-11-07', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'product_id': u'252830', u'page_order': 4, u'products': 2323, u'page': 13}
,{u'username': u"'WitteBae \U0001f339", u'text': u'Much like the film industry it often imitates, in the videogame world the definition of an \u201cindependent\u201d creation operates on a sliding scale. Outside of the sheer volume of a games production budget, there are also the questions of the development team\u2019s size, their planned distribution, and sometimes even the concept. After all, even Bungie now qualifies as an\nwhile piloting multi-million dollar projects.\nWhatever your requirements for triple-A autonomy may be though, it\u2019d probably be a safe wager that Vagabond Dog and their project Always Sometimes Monsters qualifies in nearly every way, and in this gamer\u2019s opinion, almost all of them are good.\nThe premise of Always Sometimes Monsters, on the very surface, is actually very direct. You are playing a down-and-out artist who just finished losing everything after trying to make it big. With no job, no cash, and very little hope, your character receives a letter in the mail detailing that the last thing he or she cares about is slipping their grasp forever. With nothing to lose, you set off on journey to seize whatever happiness may still await you\u2026 or very possibly die in the process. The twist that makes this title extra-special however, come from the challenges that await your hero: everyday life\u2026\nNow admittedly, there isn\u2019t much a person could think of that would seem like more of a mundane time-sink than a game about trying to make ends meet, performing great sacrifices for little reward, and the in-and-out stresses of paying your bills or doing the right thing. But Always Sometimes Monsters manages to keeps this tale engaging because your hero only has so much time to get any one thing done and achieve their ultimate goal. This creates a lot of pressure both morally and otherwise as you pilot your way past the various difficulties your hero is confronted with and what outcomes await you. Also, while many titles claim to feature it, Always Sometimes Monsters is a narrative adventure\nabout choices and how through either action or inaction the course of your characters life will be changed. Choices like how not helping your kind elderly neighbor in order to keep a promise to your friend also means never seeing her again, or how protecting your integrity as a journalist means not making enough money to pay your rent. This isn\u2019t a title simply attempting to mimic life, its mimicking a seedy variant of life that only certain individuals can empathize with but many should be able to imagine, a world where your life\u2019s gone wrong and in the process your vision of \u201cwrong\u201d has become something other than what it used to be. While at times it\u2019s more than a bit dismal, primarily it\u2019s captivating.\nAs far as presentation goes, from the moment the opening logos have faded and the title screen music has begun, everything about Always Sometimes Monsters feels like an 1980\u2019s throwback. The dialog is delivered through a series of slides beside an image of the speaker in question, your 8-bit characters move along gridded trajectories against largely un-interactive objects, and unless you scribble it down yourself there is no journal function or maps to speak of. This is bare-bones gaming by any modern standard and for the very newest generation, maybe even archaic. But in no small measure does this minimalist approach encapsulate Always Sometimes Monsters\u2019 intriguing appeal. This game was purposefully made to be a simple creation with complex guts; dynamic enough that, if you so choose, the entire journey can fully and functionally be over within the first ten minutes with the real-world press of a button and a virtual pull of a trigger. This dynamic element however, is also where Always Sometimes Monsters can sometimes lose it grasp on your imagination.\nThe more options any game or story offers a person, especially tales which are supposed to mimic \u201creal life\u201d, more options and choices a person is going to want. Always Sometimes Monsters, in its simple virtuoso of substance over style, at times paints itself into a corner with that very question of; \u201c I could do\n, why can\u2019t I do\n?" Also, the interactions with objects and NPC\u2019s can feel a bit haphazard at times, proving cumbersome beyond titles implied dogma of \u201ceven the simplest tasks can prove a challenge\u201d. As a matter of fact, if you happen to locate them in-game, there are a pair of avatars modeled after the developers who will tell you as much themselves.\nHowever, all of this only matters as much as player actually likes the story itself. Sure, Always Sometimes Monsters has to roll the dice on whether or not a player will like it\u2019s narrative as much as any other title that bothers to have one. However, in games which are\nabout the narrative, lacking any actual \u201cgameplay\u201d to speak of, this becomes a much larger concern. If you can\u2019t get beyond playing a lonely vagabond, who at times needs to sleep on the street to stay alive\u2026 sell some drugs to win someone\u2019s trust, or even believe in true love, there won\u2019t be much here to hold you. However, if you love a good story and want a really creative way to take part in telling it, there is little reason not to toss this title in your shopping cart and bring it home. At the very least to give its hero a place to sleep tonight.', u'hours': 15.8, u'date': u'2015-01-07', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 2, u'product_id': u'274310', u'page_order': 1, u'products': 2323, u'page': 96}

It includes a built in map editor.  Also, the game has a very easy learning curve... there are not that many units, so it is a good intro strategy game for when friends come over.

For me, the computer version is a way to enjoy the game without sinking much money at all into the game.  Basically, I buy the game once and play it... new decks unlock as you play through the single player campaign (hence, you do not need to spend any more money than just the base game... very different than real life where you have to buy many booster packs to build a good deck -- they only way you spend extra money is if you are impatient and want to unlock things early for multiplayer, or want special "foil" skins to cards).\nTechnically, this game is very well done.  The graphics are incredible, and the mouse zoom feels very natural.  There are no annoying glitches that I can think of off hand, other than the computer opponent sometimes gets an unbeatable hand (random luck of any card game, I suppose).  Technically, there is very little differenct between this game and previous versions... I think they are just releasing a new version each year with minor updates to keep the necessary cash flow going to support the game; I don\'t mind that, as they quality of the game gets better each time and the base cost of the game is very affordable (under $5 during sales).', u'early_access': false, u'page': 127}

A slap in the face to anyone who has owned the previous Cities game.  After a short time playing this, I've really not noticed much different at all.  The only differences being the change of colour in the UI, and possibly more formatting options when 'zoning' for buildings.\nDrawing of roads still feels the same as it was.  the curves of the roads are very angular and only really feel smooth on large winding roads. Combined with the zoning of buildings, which just seem to be square ploppable things, it makes the curved roads, and lining things up on them feel awkward at best, leading to frustrating at some occasions.\nAs far as other mechanics go, they all seem pretty much the same as they were before.  Resource mechanics boil down to rather abstract quantities which can make it a little hard to judge how much of a deficit or surplus you have in a resource.  With the resource layers also appearing to be static as well.  Placing a building just seems to consume a radius around it rather than extract the resources over time makes it feel that it's something you can just plop and abandon without much thought to it.  If resource production/extraction was dynamic based on various factors then I feel it would have presented more of a challenge, especially for later on in the game.\nEven the placing of services doesn't offer much interaction as far as I can tell.  It appears to me that by placing one it just offers a set bonus over a radius, I've not really seen much that changes this.  I think the density of road affects how far it projects, but beyond that, I can't really tell.  There's no real information as to who is using the services, how often they use them, and how easy it is to access them etc.  I can't help but hark back to SimCity4, which at least offered some information as to the quality of the service, and how many were using it.\nI suppose this one is more of an optional gripe into how the game works, and always has.  But the zoning for people is split through tiers.  So you can place rich people where you want, and poor people elsewhere.  Although this is nice if you're going for a tailor-made city.  It makes the game lose quite a chunk of the organic city growth feeling.  I always felt that the people that lived in an area, should reflect how that area grows and develops, and in turn it should visually change to represent that.  Be it becoming some crime infested slums, or millionaire mansions and parks.\nI know they've had plenty of time to implement a lot more than what they have.  It does raise questions as to why it feels as though so little has changed.  There's been plenty of inspiration and discussion from various communities centred around city building games.  Plus quite a nice amount of previous material to draw inspiration from!  I just want to know why they felt that it had to all be the same, despite it definitely having flaws from before.\nI just don't feel I could ever recommend this game, even to new players if they're looking for something that is more deep and complex in managing a city.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 65}

Logan Cunningham (the voice actor) does an excellent job of keeping the story captivating.\n- Intense music, very befitting for the story and progression of this game.\n- Lots of melee and ranged weapons (and power up for the weapons) to choose from. You can easily customize your weapons to fit your preferred fighting style.\n- Deflecting attacks with the shield is very satisfying.\n- You can further customize the protagonist (the Kid) by equipping/unequipping Spirits; you get your standard buffs from these.\n- I love how Supergiant decided to manage the difficulty setting. It is completely up to the player and can be changed any time the Kid is at the Bastion. There, you can visit a building called the Shrine where you can choose to invoke Gods (10 in total). Each God you invoke will grant you extra EXP and Currency from kills. However, they come with a side effect: enemies are more durable, move faster, deflect attacks, etc). So essentially, if you want a bigger challenge, you can invoke more gods, and in turn you will receive greater benefits.\n- There are several optional challenge rooms for those willing to test themselves; fighting waves of enemies or mastering a weapon. Naturally you are rewarded for completing these challenges.\n-\n- Two endings and New game +.\n- You will probably fall of the terrain often for two reasons. Firstly, it takes time to get used to the dodge roll. Secondly, it isn\u2019t always clear where the edge of the terrain is.\nI enjoyed playing Bastion. The story was sad but captivating.

I did not have the mana pool to continue and since MP does not regenerate in this game, I had to back track and grind to increase my special level.\n- No new game plus.

You can't really ask for much more in a FPS.\nInitially my major complaint for this game was: no trading system. Well that changed, hooray for Valve!\nLet's not celebrate too soon... the trading system, while great for people who actually use the trading system to improve playability (getting weapons they did not previously have), it has quickly spiralled into a pointless competition of showing-off the fanciest hats and items. In game purchases? Extremely rare hats that can cost up to thousands? My only question is\nThankfully these items that I would consider silly and pointless don't actually influence game play. Weapons are reasonably well balanced so there is little frustration in that regard. Having a strong, well organised team will still beat a team that simply has more items. So if you don't mind the flashy nonsense, TF2 is still definitely worth your time.", u'early_access': false, u'page': 7684}

Regardless, I found that DmC Devil may Cry stayed true to its predecessors in its core gameplay, but also introduced elements that make it a unique addition to the DmC series.\n- The combat in DmC is excellent. Mistakes are solely your fault. With all the weapons and abilities in your arsenal the number of combos you can string together is practically limitless. Watching an expert play is jaw-droppingly impressive.\n- Loved the inclusion of angel and demon weapons and their specific interactions with certain demons and the environment.\n- DmC does a great job of discouraging button mashing by including a good variety of demons, so that you adjust your fighting style to suit your enemies. It also encourages the use of different combinations to further boost your combat score; repetitive attacks will lead to lower style points.\n- The story is oriented around young Dante. I enjoyed this prequel as I never fully understood the relationship between Dante and his twin (Virgil). I also believe the story was designed to be a social criticism of sorts, which I appreciate. Though be warned, a large portion of the game consists of story/cutscenes (which are skippable on second playthroughs, thankfully).\n-\n- DmC is one of those games that you can get sickeningly good at. The high difficulty bar made me feel mediocre as a gamer. I played DmC on Nephilim (the normal \u2018hard\u2019 difficulty) and found it quite challenging. Yet there are 4 difficulty settings above that. I cannot even imagine how difficult the Hell and Hell setting is.\n- Usually I believe that I am fairly good at finding hidden content. DmC proved me wrong. I did not even find half the lost souls, keys, and doors on my own, and believe me, I tried. Most hidden content are quite well hidden or requires you to replay levels once you acquired specific weapons.\n- I enjoyed the scoring system for two reasons: [1] it shows where you can improve and what you missed in each level. [2] Since this is a single player game the scoring system serves as a medium for players to compete amongst each other.\n- During escape sequences I sometimes found the pathing unclear, but never to the point of frustration. In fact, I liked that they included these segments as it provided some downtime from all the fighting without necessarily reducing the excitement.\n- There are some segments where you are basically forced to walk from one point to the other. It was neither game play nor cutscene and it didn\u2019t add much to the game. I would have preferred if they just made a cutscene out of it.\n- Though fun and exciting, I did not find the boss fights to be particularly difficult. I found that the hardest part with the bosses was figuring out what to do (not all bosses are immediately vulnerable to your attacks). For the most part, I struggled more with fighting certain demons.\n- One of the criteria you are scored upon finishing a level is the time taken to complete the level. I found it somewhat unfair that cutscenes do not pause the timer.\nI had a lot of fun playing DmC Devil may Cry. It is just satisfying to shred demons to bits while your combo counter and combat score steadily increase. Even on my mediocre difficulty setting, I enjoyed the challenge DmC presented. I was only somewhat disappointed by the boss fights, but then again, this isn\u2019t Dark Souls. I don\u2019t know what the hardcore Devil may Cry fans think about this game but I think it is a great game for players familiar and unfamiliar with the series alike.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 32}

Oxenfree is one of those experiences that you can only have once, so I urge you to play it for yourself before watching a gameplay video. With that in mind, I wrote this review with as few spoilers as possible.\n- This game is designed spectacularly. The visuals, audio, and especially the story and character interactions are superb. It is thrilling, terrifying, and tragic.\n- The characters are actually interesting and the voice acting is spot on.\n- Things change when you start a new game. I thought the added interactions were very clever.\n- Loved the idea of carrying around a radio. You can actually tune in to music, information (lore), hints, and more while walking around.\n- Optional collectables and integrated hints that guide you towards them.\n- You walk slowly. Too slowly in my opinion. I can imagine the developers chose this pace for two reasons. 1. Many conversations happen while you are walking around, you walk slowly so you have time for character and story development. 2. So the player can appreciate the size and beauty of the island. Regardless, I often felt bored when there were no conversations and when I had to backtrack.\n- I encountered a glitch three times when I tried to move to the next screen and interact with people at the same time. My character would then be unable to proceed to the next screen. This is particularly annoying because the game only saves when you enter a new screen. In the worst case I had to reset and replay 20 minutes of interactions before I could continue.\n- I would have preferred if you could fast forward conversations. In other similar games, you can often click to skip what is currently being said, speeding up the gameplay. I can understand why this isn\u2019t allowed in your first playthrough; however, it should be unlocked (or at least an option you can toggle on) after you finish the game for the first time.\nDespite my criticisms, Oxenfree is great.

If you look up a guide it becomes clear but I don\u2019t think people should have to resort to outside help. Maybe I missed something glaringly obvious but in my experience the game did not do a great job of providing information.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u"Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is essentially an open world Lord of the Rings game. It is perhaps an improved version of Assassins Creed. Definitely an enjoyable experience and fairly great all around.\n- I would say that the main highlight of this game are the Uruk executions. They are so smooth and brutal. It is oddly satisfying to see dismembered Uruk heads fly in slow motion.\n- Combat is quite fun and flows very smoothly; it reminded me of the Batman Arkham series combat style. You have a decent arsenal of weapons and abilities to play around with. The addition of quicktime events in battle also worked well. I\u2019m usually not a fan, but it was well executed in this game.\n- Since this game primarily endorses stealth, it is nice that you are given a variety of tools to assist with being stealthy. For example, you can quickly take down enemies, lure enemies, poison grog (their beverage of choice), shoot down meat to attract Caragors (vicious giant dog-like creatures), etc. It\u2019s not my preferred playstyle, but the options kept me entertained.\n- As you progress, the Uruk ranking system becomes more meaningful, especially after you unlock the branding ability. Suddenly you can battle their ranking system from within and force the Uruk to betray one another. Uruks also remember if they encountered you before and will act accordingly. If you ran away they will taunt you for your cowardice. If they killed you they will guarantee that you will die again. This dynamic makes Shadow of Mordor quite unique.\n- I didn\u2019t care much for most of the characters: very generic tragic heroes for the most part (not that I can blame them, considering their backstory). However, Ratbag and Torvin are great; two of the few characters that actually have a sense of humour. They made me laugh several times.\n- Great attention to detail. Like the unique Uruk appearances and personalities, the runes on your weapons, or the addition of Ithildin. I especially like that the Uruk chant the Warchief\u2019s name when he shows up.\n- If you get the game of the year edition there are some nice extras, including two campaigns. I particularly enjoyed the Lord of the Hunt campaign because 1. you get to spend more time with Torvin; 2. compared to the main campaign, there is more variety to beasts/interacting with beasts. However, it is a shame that the controls don't feel as fluid when riding beasts.\n- The world is fairly small, but in this case, that\u2019s a good thing. Everything is fairly close by and you can unlock towers to fast travel to. You are always moments away from excitement. There are also skills and mounts that can help you travel faster so there is very little down time.\n- Despite all the efforts to make this game quite diverse, i.e. different Uruk war chiefs with different weaknesses and abilities, different options to wreak havoc and kill Uruks, etc; this game still felt quite repetitive. Basically, you go from one point to the next killing Uruks, some of which are harder to kill than others.\n- Often the cutscene audio was out of sync. Not sure if this is a mistake on my end, but I didn\u2019t touch the audio settings before encountering this issue. I expect the default settings to work.\n- For some reason Uruks will spawn endlessly. I find this a very strange decision on the part of the developers. Let me explain further. There are several camps in the game, naturally, they are full of enemies. If you are seen, an Uruk can raise the alarm, alerting the camp. Ok, makes sense. Here\u2019s the issue: I don\u2019t mind that I get seen, but I want to be able to win. Even if there are over 100 Uruk in a camp, theoretically you should be able to take them down one by one until you\u2019re the only one left, right? Nope. They just keep spawning infinitely, and I don\u2019t mean they only respawn when you exit and renter an area. They will literally respawn within meters from you only moments after you killed a few Uruk. I can understand that stealth is emphasized, but it shouldn\u2019t be shoved down my throat. If I want to charge in head on it should be possible. More difficult, perhaps, but not impossible.\n- It is a bit unnecessary that you must go through an unskippable cutscene every time a Captain sees you. This is especially obnoxious when a Warchief has several Captains as bodyguards and they tell you one by one how ugly you are (lol) or how they can\u2019t wait to kill you. I enjoy their lines, but not the fact that the whole game stops just so you can hear them say it.\n-\nOverall, Shadow of Mordor is very well executed.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u"Space Epic Untitled is a 3D space shooter with a slight twist: with your phones or tablets, you can easily add 2 extra players to your ship. Jolly cooperation! Great concept, but the game is very unpolished and has practically no player base at the moment.\n- Audio is possibly the most polished aspect of this game. The sounds and voice acting are decent, and the music is actually quite nice.\n- This game is centred around playing with friends. The mobile app add on is interesting and works surprisingly well (I experienced no connection issues). With one pc and 2 phones/tablets you can form a three-man crew, all operating on the same ship. I think this concept is great and has a lot of potential. However, it is a shame that ads play on the app, even when you are in the middle of a game. I understand that free games/apps need to resort to ads for revenue, but it should not distract the player from the game.\n- It\u2019s nice that you have the option to name your ship and choose up to 3 different weapons. It would be nice if they allowed you to customize the appearance of the ship too.\n- No one is really playing this. Online multiplayer doesn\u2019t work without other players. I can\u2019t really fault the game itself for this, but the current player base is far too low.\n- The app can be improved. No sound comes from the app. This isn\u2019t an issue if you\u2019re all playing the game in the same room. This wasn\u2019t the case for me and my brother, so it would be nice if sounds were introduced. It should also be considered that players who don\u2019t use the app will be at a disadvantage. I think it\u2019s very important that the developers address this issue, because it will become a large issue if the community grows.\n- Honestly I have little experience with spaceship/flight games, so I\u2019m not very good at piloting ships. The controls are responsive, but feel quite sensitive, so any small movement can lead you to your demise. Maybe that is just my lack of experience.\n- Asteroids will kill you in one hit. Even if you nick just the tip of your ship, BOOM, you\u2019re dead. Lasers from enemy ships, on the other hand, will damage your health accordingly.\n- You are expected to mine ores from asteroids. This can be done by shooting the asteroid and driving into the ore. I encountered a glitch where I could not pick up the floating ore. I drove into it 3 times but the game would not register. Furthermore, there is little indication that your shots are doing anything. It takes many shots before the asteroid starts to crack so I often felt that my shots weren\u2019t doing anything.\n- The images/graphics used in this game are clearly of low quality.\n- Difficult to exit the game. I had to resort to alt+f4.\nSpace Epic Untitled surprised me. Considering the mediocre title, cover image, and game graphics, I was expecting the worst, but It's not all bad. The music, for example, is great. Although I cannot recommend this game in its current state, I believe it has a lot of potential. I am very intrigued by the inclusion of a mobile app and surprised by how well it works. Yes, the app idea is fantastic, but the core game is lacking. I think the developers should focus on creating a fulfilling experience without focusing too heavily on the app. There's a lot of work to be done to improve this game.", u'hours': 0.7, u'date': u'2017-11-04', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'product_id': u'613800', u'page_order': 6, u'products': 343, u'page': 1}

This series is a staple in early flash games, so the addition of a new title is a very welcome rush of nostalgia. However, despite my love for the series, I must admit that I am a little disappointed with the length of Super Fancy Pants Adventure. While the core mechanics are better than ever, there is far too little content.\nLike many fans of the Fancy Pants games, the Super Fancy Pants Adventure release made me giddy with excitement. As to be expected, the movement, platforming, and combat are all great. However, Super Fancy Pants Adventure feels incomplete. The \u201cto be continued\u201d ending left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I really hope that more content will be added soon, because as it currently stands I don\u2019t believe this game deserves the \u201cSuper \u2026 Adventure\u201d title. I enjoyed playing SFPA, but considering that you will only get 2-3 hours of gameplay out of it, I don\u2019t think it is worth 10\u20ac.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u'BANANO BROS strikes hard with feelings of nostalgia. The gameplay, look, and even music represent retro games very well. Although I did not play it for very long, I enjoyed my time doing so. Perhaps I have a soft spot for well made retro games.\n- The BANANO BROS is exactly what you expect it to be: 80s arcade game style, endless vertical runner, avoid bugs and coconuts, and the only objective is to beat your previous high score. If you accept it for what it is, then you will not be disappointed.\n- Despite it\u2019s simple look, BANANO BROS feels well put together: there are different songs (a song select option would be nice), the background slowly moves upwards, the speed increases, the time of day changes, and you receive a temporary a power up after every 50 bananas. Yes, these are pretty basic elements, but it\u2019s nice to see that the basics were not taken for granted. The gameplay is already quite repetitive, so I appreciated the variety in other departments.\n- Although I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to try 2 players and versus mode yet, I am eager to do so. I\u2019m very glad that these game modes were included.\n- Some of the achievements felt very \u201ccheap\u201d. For example, open the options, check the controls, see the credits. You shouldn\u2019t be rewarding the player for such meaningless things. I feel like it reflects badly on the game itself.\n- There are a few things I want to point out about the gameplay that could be fixed. 1. The monkey hitbox is bigger than its body. The coconut hits me even though I should be able to scrape by. 2. If you jump and land on the very bottom of the vine, the monkey hovers beneath the vine. The second point isn\u2019t necessarily a criticism, just an observation. 3. When the background transitions from day to night, it can be difficult to see the coconut.\n- I got tired of it fast. This could just be a personal preference though, since I\u2019ve never really obsessed about beating a high score. I\u2019m much more interested in exploring and being challenged when gaming, so this game is simply a bad matchup for me. I think you should decide for yourself whether this game will suit you or not.\nThis is a game I would maybe recommend. In my opinion BANANO BROS is neither good or bad, just a fun time waster. I find that the trailer and description portray BANANO BROS very well, so I suggest you make an instinctive decision on whether you want this game or not.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u'Disclaimer: I have not played Darksiders II: Deathinitive edition. I have played the original Darksiders II, though. In this review I will assume that the core game did not change much between editions.\n- Combat, combat, combat. I\u2019d say the core focus of this game is combat, and Darksiders goes a great job at it. Controls are responsive and it feels great to dish out huge combos. If you are a fan of Devil May Cry -style combat, you will probably like this game too.\n- I enjoyed the challenge of some battles. I remember struggling at some points in the game.\n- Plenty of drops and equips to choose from, so you can customize your equipment to better suit your playstyle. Different weapons, for example, have different attack speeds, attack patterns, damage, elemental damage, etc. You can also upgrade some of your weapons. I also enjoyed that the equipment (armour, boots, gloves, etc) actually change your in game appearance.\n- The world is fairly large: plenty to explore, plenty to do. There are collectibles scattered around, so keep your eyes peeled. Very glad they included a fast travel option.\n- Wall running, jumping, and climbing work well. This may be a minor detail, but since there are many segments where you use these abilities, it adds up over time. Their smooth execution really helps with the flow of the game. I especially like that climbing isn\u2019t slow.\n- NPCs and lore are interesting. I won\u2019t go into much detail, but it\u2019s nice to see that effort was put into the backstory of Darksiders I and II.\n- Nice incorporation of puzzles. I did not find them particularly difficult but if they were excluded, the game would be too focused on killing everything in sight.\n- Some puzzles were unnecessarily simple. They didn\u2019t add much to the game, they were just there for the sake of being there.\n- Bugs and crashes. In my case, the flying serpent cut scene would not trigger when I reached serpent\u2019s peak. I had to restart the game and backtrack for it finally trigger.\n- It\u2019s not always clear what you must do. I found myself wandering aimlessly a few times. But on the other hand, aimlessly exploring helps you find dungeons, items, and other secrets.\n- Typical 3rd person frustrations with the camera, however, this was a non-issue most of the time.\nDarksiders II shines bright when you are in combat. It is just satisfying to fight creatures much bigger than yourself and combo them to shreds. Everything else was OK to me. The game runs well and there are sufficient hours of gameplay to keep you entertained. I would only recommend this game to those excited by the combat.', u'hours': 7.5, u'date': u'2017-10-20', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'product_id': u'388410', u'page_order': 4, u'products': 343, u'page': 15}

Although the premise is simple, you can tell that a lot of care was put into the development of City Climber. I applaud SimpleGhost for creating such a great product despite having a small budget and working on it solo.\nIn City Climber, you essentially control the left and right arms of a ragdoll. With your infallible grip and gorilla-strength arms, you take on many challenges by doing what you do best \u2013 climbing. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to try the co-op mode, so this review will focus on single player.\nCity Climber is a prime example of what one person can achieve. Simple, but well executed. SimpleGhost managed to create a great game by investing only time and hard work - you are a great inspiration for many aspiring game developers.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u'I\u2019ve been wanting to play Jotun for over a year but only recently, when the game was temporarily free, I picked it up. I like what Thunder Lotus Games was trying to do: explore Nordic mythology and fight giant bosses? Sounds great.\nBoy was I disappointed. Boss fights might be the only interesting aspect of the game. The rest is unnecessarily long, slow, and content-less.\n- Bosses are challenging, especially as the game progresses. Odin took more than a few tries.\n- The guy in the well (Mimir) creeps me out. - the attention to detail here is fabulous. Great job.\n- Good variety of God powers. The number of charges per power also seemed fair.\n- You don\u2019t come across Nordic mythology very often in video games. Especially not a game that delves deeper into the stories behind the Gods.\n- The word Ginnungagap makes me giggle.\n- My biggest issue with Jotun is the lack of content. There is just too much empty space. I understand that the big maps make you reflect on how small your character is in comparison to everything else. However, there is just so little to do. Additionally, your character only has one speed (without the use of God powers). Super slow. I found myself frustrated at how boring it was to explore each map. I enjoyed the different gimmicks (snow, lava, etc) but it just wasn\u2019t enough to make each level interesting. This game would have been more fun if only the bosses were included, which is a huge shame.\n- Inconsistent with the quality of graphics and animations. Some things look amazing, while others just sloppy. For example, when you drink from Mimir\u2019s well, the detail on both the graphics and animations are fantastic. On the other hand, when you hit dwarves with your axe they hover back and after a brief delay throw their arms up in pain. Maybe this was done for comedic effect, but I thought it looked terrible.\n- When you character attacks, she is rooted in place. Additionally, her attacks in general are also quite slow. When you combine these two elements, it makes combat very static and stutter-y. It doesn\u2019t pair well with the fact that you are expected to move a lot. For these reasons, I didn\u2019t enjoy the melee combat, but I guess that is a matter of taste.\nOverall the game is very\u2026 dull. Your character is slow. Melee attacks are slow. Even opening gates is unnecessarily slow. Too much map to explore with too little content. Shame because the boss fights, God powers, and mythology were interesting.

,{u'username': u"'b", u'text': u'Like many Steam users, I picked up ICEY during the crazy ICEY + Steam link bundle sale. Initially my eyes were only on the Steam link, so I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the game. Eventually I decided to give ICEY a chance. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did. I should have just let ICEY die in the depths of my Steam library.\n- Visually the game looks alright. The art style isn\u2019t my favourite, but it\u2019s quite well made. The animations are good too.\n- There is a decent number of combos, which is always nice for a hack and slash. Unfortunately, these are the only positive aspects I could think of.\n- The narrator actually makes the game less enjoyable. This is a big downside because the narrator talks a lot. A LOT. To make matters worse, you are often stuck in a room until he decides to shut his mouth. I get the gimmick the developer was going for, but I honestly felt like it didn\u2019t work. Games that are narrator driven, such as the Stanley Parable, require excellent voice acting and scripts. ICEY has neither of those. The narrator\u2019s words are emotionally shallow, his script is too long and offers very little entertainment, and when you disobey him he is repetitively condescending. He complains about how difficult it is to make a game and that he wants to \u201cmake it enjoyable\u201d for the player. Ironically, this whining made the game less enjoyable. I actually turned off the volume to maintain my sanity.\n- This game rewards exploration with tedious cutscenes.  Again, this is a criticism of the running gimmick that the narrator is the developer. In addition to the obnoxiously long talk sequences, there are dull cutscenes that show the narrator/developer typing in code to modify/reset the game. Clever gimmick, poor execution. The excessive pauses really ruin the flow of the game and decreases it\u2019s enjoyability.\n- I didn\u2019t enjoy the story. Probably not surprising considering how much I disliked the narrator. Let me give you a quick summary: \u201ckill Judas\u201d, *rants about you not listening* \u201cyou should be killing Judas\u201d, \u201chey, that guy is affiliated with Judas, kill it\u201d, *more complaining*, \u201ctime to kill Judas\u201d.\n- Unfortunately, there were many instances that made the combat feel unfair. Firstly, the controls can be unresponsive at times. I can\u2019t tell you how many times ICEY decided not to dash even though I was mashing RB (no, I was not stunned, and yes, I had charges for my dash). Secondly, it can be hard to dodge attacks sometimes because the pre-attack animations can be extremely short, especially with the two final bosses. Finally, once your shield is down, any damage will stagger you. Seriously, you\u2019re as fragile as a baby; a 1 damage attack will make ICEY collapse. Combine that with the lack of invincibility frames and you\u2019re in for a treat. For example, an enemy can just stun lock you in place, allowing other enemies to pile on the damage, or the final boss\u2019 laser can juggle you in mid-air and hit you up to 5 times within 1 second (5*20 damage). I feel like the developer didn\u2019t know how to manage difficulty, so he just decided to remove invincibility frames.\nICEY was a truly unpleasant experience. Playing ICEY was like doing chores while someone is constantly nagging about what you should do and how you should do it. The combat was decent, but the script and narration made this game unbearable. Funnily enough, the element that makes this game stand out: the META narration, is exactly what makes it terrible. I don\u2019t recommend this game to anyone. However, if you insist on playing it, I suggest turning the volume off and having a book on the side so you can read during the cutscenes.', u'hours': 5.5, u'date': u'2017-11-04', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 7, u'product_id': u'553640', u'page_order': 3, u'products': 343, u'page': 31}

I never had any issues with the gameplay mechanics.\n- Looks good and sounds good but it\u2019s nothing spectacular. I did find that the music tied in very well with the cyberpunk theme.\n- I liked how the whole story/setting ties in very well with the gameplay. For example, every time you respawn, your character comes out from a new pod, which also happens to be numbered. More details will be revealed as complete the game.\n- The main selling point of Neon Chrome is replayability. Levels are randomly generated, and once you\nthe game you unlock harder difficulties. There are also numerous classes, weapons, upgrades, and abilities you can unlock and pick from.\n- I enjoyed the learning curve in Neon Chrome. This game wasn\u2019t designed to be easy. If you don\u2019t play carefully, you will eventually be swarmed by enemies and end up dead. Difficulty progression felt fair and logical;\n- The destructible environment can play greatly in your favour or against you. This kind of ties in with the difficulty and learning curve of the game. Breaking walls can help you execute sneak attacks on your enemies, but at the same time, provides passage for other enemies to charge at you. Proceed with caution.\n-\n- Despite all the different options, it doesn\u2019t feel like there is much variability In Neon Chrome. Within two hours I already figured out which classes, upgrades, and weapons I preferred. Within 4 hours I beat the game and I unlocked a harder difficulty.

I won\u2019t go into much detail because practically every review will tell you the same thing.\n- Story will tug on your heart strings. Love is a beautiful thing.\n- Once you unlock most abilities, movement becomes very fun. I felt like I was playing a very agile monkey. Bouncing on projectiles/enemies was extremely satisfying.\n- It took a while for me to get used to the save/checkpoint system. In Ori and the blind forest, you can create a checkpoint given that: 1. you have sufficient energy; 2. you are on the ground; 3. you are in a safe location (no enemies nearby). I didn\u2019t like this system at first because you can set yourself up for failure/frustration. If you save in a difficult location when you are at low HP, you will have a bad time. However, as the game progresses and you become wiser, creating your own checkpoints is actually very empowering.\n- Plenty of hidden collectibles, some of which are quite hard to find.\n- This game was more challenging than expected. It looks fairly simple in the trailer but I assure you that it is not. It was not unmanageably hard (even though I played on hard) nor a walk in the park. Challenging and achievable.\n- Fairly short. I finished the game (with about 80% completion) in about 6 hours, without the use of a guide or outside help. It took another 2 (with a guide) to get 100%. I expected the game to be longer. Regardless, the content is of great quality and there is replay value.\n- I didn\u2019t particularly like the auto lock-on spirit fire attack. It felt cheesy and spammable. This is fairly minor as well though because there are plenty of other ways to kill enemies.\n- Even if you have already visited warp points before you must unlock an ability for their location to show up on the map. I can understand that you are required to spend ability points for collectibles (like life and energy cells) to show up on the map \u2013 they would be too easy to find otherwise. However, in my opinion, basic components (like warps you have already unlocked) should appear without needing extra abilities.\nI have been excited to play Ori and the blind forest since its release. Some games just speak out to you, you know? However, I only bought the game recently (over one year after release). During that time I probably hyped myself up too much and ended up expecting a longer game.

Despite not being proficient at games, she really enjoyed playing it. There is a brilliant balance between the playability and difficulty in this game. The controls and rules are simple enough that anyone can pick them up, while the challenge comes from clever level design and partner coordination. The puzzles never felt unfair, but often made us scratch our heads.\nI suspect that Death Squared is not as popular as it could be due to the local co-op limitation. Regardless, I find that video games are usually best enjoyed as a local co-op experience, since the emotions shared become exponentially more vivid. Like\nand\n, I find that Death Squared is a fantastic example of a game best experienced locally.

It\'s certainly not perfectly playable, and key features are certainly missing, such as global voice chat muting (we had to leave a lobby while streaming from the "banter" in the background) but it\'s still a blast now, and will only improve in the future.\nI\'m a long time GMT player since the almighty Yogs first made their videos about it. I fell in love with lobby 1, had literally the sickest apartment (I still have my screenshots lying around somewhere) and made so many friends through it.\nThen along came the opportunity as a donor to alpha/beta test lobby 2. The improvements that were made were astonishing, the outdoor explorable environments were such a huge change from what had become a slightly claustrophobic Lobby 1. Yet at Lobby 2\'s release, many planned features were still not available, and soon after came the news that Lobby 2 and the whole GMT mod was being transformed to a standalone game in Tower Unite.\nI missed out on the crowdfunding by 2 days, somehow it flew under my radar. But here it is now.\nBeing Early Access the game is fairly buggy, as is to be expected. and the new Planet Panic is horrid for FPS lag.Then again, it\'s still the game I love, and I\'ve already found people I remember from over 4 years ago! Minigolf and Ball Race outside of the few niggles I\'ve had still feel like the game I know, but with a slight upgrade now. Unreal 4 is 50x better for this than the Source engine. Virus plays about 1000x better now for me. The Lobby looks even more beautiful in UE4, and at the launch of Lobby 2 I didn\'t think that would be possible.\nOther problems at the moment include a memory leak, a lot of areas not particularly optimised, and a lack of key bindings. (that will be fixed soon) However with their fast ability to patch the game, 8 patches within 15 days of EA release, problems are quickly being ironed out and new content becoming available. Problems I\'ve noted here before that are now fixed include, object interaction in 3rd person, inability to connect to plazas/game hosts and being unable to hit the ball in minigolf, causing in a penalty.\nI\'ll be updating this as my opinion changes hopefully (if I remember)', u'early_access': true, u'page': 290}

I think a more open world (massive fields/areas) would work better.  The farm should in the middle of the world (like a donut) with the biomes spread around it and each biome has a selection of different slimes, the further you go outward from your farm the more varied or aggressive the slimes and slime combinations become, along with merging biomes.\nThen you can have a teleporter for each direction that you need to unlock so.you can fast travel through the world instead of continually running the same corridor to get to where you want to go.\nThe spawn of slimes.\nThere doesn't seem to be any logic behind the spawn of slimes, you go to a biome and there is a selection that spawn in that biome everywhere, a random amount of a random selection of the slimes. The only solid spawn of slimes is the first area right outside your farm.\nThis does not include the amount of slimes that spawn, there are just so many slimes, and they seem to want to eat any plotting that spawns as quick as they can, so trying to get a base slime is difficult as they are all largo?, Slimes.\nPredesigned building locations\nThis is the part  starting to grind on me, I have bought almost all of the building locations but the extra ones off the sides of the farm are just too far out from the main farm to be anything other than storage of slime types and excess food simply because it's just a chore to go to them, feed them or collect from them and then go back to the farm to sell etc.\nI think it should be a single open area that you can build a plot anywhere, kind of like the building on rust or hurtworld, which would allow you to build larger enclosures for the slimes as the current ones only hold 20 small comfortably or 8/9 big ones.\nEven then you could build the lab or sheds for night creatures or whatever anywhere on your farm,\nI just think that once you've played for more than 3-4 hours the whole game starts to become tedious and starts to show its errors around customisation collecting and organising the farm. Maybe having multiple farms where you have to complete certain criteria to advance to the next and then unlock more building and slime options the further you get I to the game would be better. Along with a open ended game mode where you have the donut map or a procedural map where.you can build your farm anywhere in the world but the main building is always in the center.", u'early_access': true, u'page': 614}
,{u'username': u"'norabseven", u'text': u"EDIT: My experience so far is that I thought the game was and Early Access game, there are countless improvements that could be made still, has this even been play tested?\nThe game so far is confusing and a little vauge so i can't really fault the story/gameplay at the moment but i would not recommend this game purely for the controls\n1. The camera rotation not being centred on the player character and instead just in front of it. So turning left off-sets the character from the centre of the screen. Not a big problem but highly annoying when exploring and your character is constantly offset. Making the camera rotation axis fixed to the player character would make this feel so much better because right now it just feels wrong.\n2. Keyboard and mouse player action direction being from the player direction and not the camera direction. If i'm trying to collect materials or smash a box i need to move the character to face towards the object which involves either trying to do fine movements with the keyboard or running completely away from the object and running straight back to it, instead of just turning the camera with the mouse and clicking. If the player actions were instead connected to the mouse direction instead of the player direction this again would make it feel so much better.\n3. Changing tools to use an object feels pointless, If i want to smash a stone i need to change to the hammer, then if i want to mine i need to change to the pickaxe even though i am carrying every single tool on my person. Adding in a 'Master Action' button that just auto-uses the correct tool for the object you are looking at would make this so much better, also, making the change tool menu in the top left actually move in the direction you move the mouse wheel instead of just insta changing the selected tool, I'm constantly changing tools in the opposite direction to what i way because I don't know which way my tool selection wheel is going.\n4. Picking up objects gives you no indication of what object you have picked up. I could run through a field and pick up every object in sight and unless it's a new object i've not picked up before, i'm given no indication of what the object was or home many i've currently got in inventory (unless i stand still for a moment to stare at the object ofc, but everyone will just run over them and spam collect).\nThis leaves you unsure what how much of a certain item you have collected, so if you have a sub-quest you need 8 flowers for or a crafting recipe, you either need to constantly check you inventory or open your compass. Having a small notification pop up when you collect items showing both what you've collected and how many you have in inventory would help so so so much, especially i imagine later on in game when crafting becomes much more complicated.\n5. The inventory screens. I mean come-on who in their right mind has both a full screen inventory screen and zero 'on-hover' information panels for an inventory screen?. I want to be able to hover over an item in my inventory and see what it is and not have to click every item, which picks it up so i need to put it back down, and i want to be able to see my surroundings while i'm in the  inventory, it's a nice looking world i want to see it while i do things.\nI could also mention there being no filters / searching / organising or anything either but i can live without them as there currently doesn't seem to be an inventory size cap so you can just hold everything i think.\n6. Opening a menu with a button should close the menu. When i press 'TAB' to open the inventory why can i not press 'TAB' again to close it ?.. Same with the maps and pressing 'M', it should both open and close the screen.\nThere are a bunch of other reasons why I would not recommend the game. But these are the most direct influences to my experience of the game so far. I will of course change and update this as time goes on if i can get used to how it is currently or not, but i think makeing or adding in additional options to suit the above would help the game be more suitable to more people.\n20170718", u'hours': 1.5, u'date': u'2017-07-18', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 1, u'product_id': u'580200', u'page_order': 2, u'products': 442, u'page': 64}

,{u'username': u"'norabseven", u'text': u'Don\'t buy it.. Wait for it to be on sale for.. well.. for Free.\nI have never once regreted buying anything on steam ever, but this game i regret.\nI can\'t be bothered with spelling and grammar so i\'ll just list things, eaiser to get the point across.\nI had to double check that this wasn\'t in early access because it just doesn\'t feel like a game, especially one that warrants \xa33.00+ for.\nIt feels like a game made from one of them poor youtube tutorial videos, there is litterally nothing to it. I\'ve dabbled with unity and what i\'ve seen of the game so far you could make it in a day or weekend, totally not worth the money.\nCons:\n-No options menus at all, no sound, graphics or controls menus nothing. Only 2 buttons "New game" and "Exit".\n-It is NOT and i repeat NOT! a fast paced game from what i\'ve played, you don\'t get timed at all, so it appears you can play a level for 10 hours and still complete it.\n-The feel of player position to the camera seemed offset, i was constantly missing jumps, even basic level 1 jumps.\n-Game uses "Tricks" to win, identical looking level complete doorways with no visual difference and if you enter the wrong one you lose. So think of the "Impossible Quiz" where you would trial and error the game.\n-Other than tricks the levels don\'t hold any difficulty with no timer, you walk from \'A to B\' and don\'t fall down, some blocks might fall from beneath you but they seem different coloured so just avoid them if you need to stop.\n-No Graphics options, Sound options, control options, mouse sensativity options nothing.\n-It has the caption "Speedrun" but you don\'t even need to run.\nHeres the big one. They included what looks like a DRM free version of the game inside the steam installer that is supposed to be used if the game crashes on start up. WHICH IT DOES. The game crashes on start up, this is not early access but a full release.\nPros:\n-It is a game, if you like running to the end of different corridors buy it and play it. I can\'t think of anything other than that.\nConclusion:\nYes i may be negative, but it is a simple game that anyone who has a remote clue of Unity or UDK could make. There is nothing that pushes the boundaries of gaming involved, you could play doodlej**p and or flappythingy and get as much difficulty or more out of them.\nTo be honest,  i don\'t know what i expected when i bought the game. But unless you have a passion for this sort of game or if you have more money than sense. Don\'t get this game, you will play if for maybe 10mins and probably never touch it again.\nI have not spell checked or grammar checked.', u'hours': 0.1, u'date': u'2015-01-27', u'early_access': false, u'found_funny': 4, u'product_id': u'346650', u'page_order': 2, u'products': 442, u'page': 2}

Music is pumping and gives an energizing feel to the game. Sound design is well-made; the red missile/limiter smashing into the ground feels nice and heavy, though maybe a bit too heavy when more of them fall at once and break my eardrums. Levels have branching paths which brings some interesting diversity into the game, and the paths themselves are generally smooth, save for the last level. Similarly, the controls are precise, especially when running.\nNow the bits I\'m concerned with. It all feels kinda same-y. Follow the green paths, ping off when the red things appear, jump the jump pads. It was starting to feel a bit tedious by the end. The artstyle, while I did like it, only consisted of blue-grays for the environment. Some variety would be appreciated. There seemed to be little use for the speed-boost button besides for making jumps at low speed. The roll is mapped to E, F and C, all of which are very awkward to press if you\'re holding down D for "move right". While I like how you directed the player with giant arrows, this meant taking your eyes off the road to look up at them, which broke the flow. First-person works, but those flips and rolls you do are very disorienting. The ping also seems like a cop-out when you\'re faced with a whole bunch of red-zones, as you can simply ping off and run through an empty platform. Not very exciting. Also, story was very much removed from gameplay. Is progress being made to save the internet? I don\'t know, I\'m just running along, following this premade path. The praise at the end and "saving the internet" feels undeserving, almost condecending.\nSo overall, can I reccomend this game? I\'d give a tenative "yes", but if I wanted to play an expanded version of this, it would need a full can of polish.', u'early_access': false, u'page': 55}

Get the first game instead.\nWhile ES2 definitely has its good sides, it also comes with half a dozen of things it just doesn\'t have compared to the prdecessor, especially in regards to combat. For example:\nYou are severely limited in your ship designs. They only have a few slots in which you can fit some of the not exactly numerous options of this category. You want a tank-ship designed to take hits? It\'s not going to be any tougher than the rest and in order to make the ai target it, you have to put a special component into your already very few slots. Your options for tactics are extremely limited, you can split your fleet in combat into multiple battle groups, but there was no way to see what these actually do, because EVERY single battle ends already on long distance.\nSmaller ship hulls have literally 0 advantages over bigger ones and their difference in power is far beyond extreme. It can\'t be that my fleet with 3 medium ships focused on damage with tech 3 modules got only one third of the defense and less than a fifth of the firepower of one large ship with the first modules in the game and only rockets - The weapon system with the second-lowest DPS!\nOh yeah, there are also only 3 hull sizes and 6 hulls in total...\nA friend of mine also noticed some glitches with his dust-income. Without an active event or any other apparent cause, it went extremely low from one turn to another.

A shame that it has gone\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665instead of improving.\nIt was silly fun and just seeing the astounding incomeptence, laziness, creativity and sometimes ingenuity that was put into designing all kinds of vehicles, aircraft and other\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665was motivation enough to play another battle. Improving my bots to rank up in tier to earn higher rewards was going fast enough and improving and optimizing my abominations was lots of fun, made me feel like some kind of mad scientist competing with lots of other mad scientists for the ultimate battle-bot. The lack of HP-regeneration added a lot of tactical depth and enabled hit and run-tactics as a valid strategy. Designing your bots to be protective of the, back then, required drivers seat made protecting it properly quite important and challenging, because it shouldnt impact your weapon systems too much.\nThat was of course long before they introduced all these new and, in the most cases, utterly \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 changes.\nAmong them are utterly underpowered weapon systems (like both Flak or the stupendously energy-hungry Ion Emitters or whatever they were called), this stupid Matchmaking system based on your vehicles total CPU that robbed at least me of the former sense of progression, the utterly unrewarding excuse for an reward-system that gives you a few, random \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 parts and shows you the good stuff you didnt get because you dont have a premium account (after getting my 3 days of free prem, strangely the quality of the rewards didn\'t hold up to the advertised rewards, but I played only about 10-15 matches), HP-regeneration Call o\' Doody-style, ridding armor blocks almost entirely of their protective purposes, reducing them to purely structural and cosmetic purposes...\nNow on the other hand, Team Deathmatch is void of all tactic and even Elimination Mode rarely shows a level of tactics that goes further than forming a blob to steamroll your enemy or hding behind a rock to wait for your mataphorically bleeding eyes to reassemble themselves and stop bleeding.\nBut the very worst of all, a workshop where you can "buy" other players designs, making quite effective and powerful designs available to every single scrub (who has acces to mommy\'s credit card, for you apparently have to pay for every single block used in it) and effectively ridding the game almost entirely of its former experimental and hilarious bot-designs, killing creativity and diversity.\nNow it seems to be all about stuffing as many shields and (prefereably useful) weapon systems as possible onto your downloaded, stronk bots, if there is even any room for any more...\nEven the default bots a friend of mine got when he made a new account were quite hefty and so effective, that he uninstalled the game because it was too easy for him.\nRest in Pepperoni, Robocraft.

I'll make a list.\n1. Unfortunatly Long lobby times, for the 2ish hours i had the game i spend a good 30-45 minutes actually playing. Sadly you cannot start a game until the lobby is full.\n2. Unbelievably small maps. I wouldn't mind counter-strike sized maps, these maps were downright TINY. I could run to the otherside with a brainer and bumrush a team in less than 3 seconds from start.\n3. Connection to other players was a biggy for me. The actual game time i did get in, was filled to the brim with TERRIBLE latency. most of the time it was 1 player with a good connection and the rest with literally a thread of connection. I would melee someone and get stuck in 1 place for 30-40 seconds, then die.\n4. m&k are NOT for this game. To enjoy this game fully you will need a controller. I used my DS4 perfectly. The response was nice and the game was fluid with the controller.\n5. Last but not least ( Opinion ) the game is great, But with all these glaring issues and literally a dead player base on launch, either buy the game on console where you KNOW theres gonna be people playing for atleast 3 months or just skip this game, the Experiment mode was laughably boring.
