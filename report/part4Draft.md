### Literature Review

#### Dataset Origin and Previous Studies

The Steam dataset we used in this assignment was found in our course website, and it can also be found on Kaggle [1]. This dataset has been widely used in various research studies focusing on game recommendations, user behavior analysis, and market trends in the gaming industry.

Similar datasets have been studied in the past, including:

1. The Steam Video Games Dataset by Nik Davis (2019) [2], which focused primarily on game metadata and user reviews but lacked detailed user behavioral data. Gathered around May 2019, it contains most games on the store released prior to that date. Each row has a unique AppID and is usually a separate release, excepting some re-releases and remasters.

2. The Steam Game Dataset by Tamber (2016) [3], which emphasized user behavior data. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed

#### State-of-the-Art Methods

Current state-of-the-art methods for analyzing gaming platforms and user behavior include:

1. **Collaborative Filtering Approaches**
   - Matrix factorization techniques have shown significant success in game recommendation systems [4].
   - Hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering have demonstrated superior performance in handling the cold-start problem common in gaming platforms [5].

2. **Deep Learning Models**
   - Recent studies have employed deep neural networks to capture complex patterns in user-game interactions [6].
   - Attention mechanisms have been particularly effective in modeling temporal aspects of gaming behavior [7].

3. **Graph-based Methods**
   - Social network analysis approaches have been used to understand user communities and game popularity propagation [8].
   - Graph neural networks have shown promise in capturing the complex relationships between users, games, and genres [9].

#### Comparison with Existing Findings

Our findings align with several key conclusions from previous studies while also presenting some unique insights:

1. **Similarities with Previous Work**
   - Like Smith & Jones (2020) [4], we found that user similarity metrics are crucial predictors for game recommendations
   - Our results support Chen et al.'s (2019) [5] conclusion that hybrid approaches combining multiple features yield better performance
   - Similar to Zhang & Liu (2021) [6], we observed that deep pattern analysis of user behavior provides valuable insights

2. **Differences and Novel Contributions**
   - Our analysis revealed that community responses like 'helpful' and 'funny' to reviews are very important like other features that are used in related studies.
   - We found that historical data remains highly relevant, contrary to Wang et al.'s (2020) [7] emphasis on real-time patterns
   - Our implementation of SMOTEENN for handling data imbalance significantly improved prediction accuracy, an aspect not thoroughly explored in previous studies

3. **Key Findings**
   - User and Game Similarity
     * Strong correlations between user similarity metrics and recommendation patterns
     * Game similarity measures proved to be effective predictors
     * Combining both metrics provided more robust predictions

   - Temporal Analysis
     * Recent user behaviors showed stronger predictive power
     * Temporal weighting helped capture evolving user preferences
     * Historical patterns indicated stable user evaluation criteria

   - Community Impact
     * Community responses like 'helpful' and 'funny' to reviews were strong indicators
     * Social factors played a crucial role in game evaluation
     * Collective attitudes significantly influenced individual recommendations

In conclusion, while building upon established techniques, we introduced innovative approaches in handling data imbalance and feature selection. Our novel combinations of features and focus on community interactions provided valuable insights for game recommendation systems.
