### Literature Review

#### Dataset Origin and Previous Studies

The Steam dataset used in this project was originally collected and made available by Tamber in 2019 [1]. This dataset has been widely used in various research studies focusing on game recommendations, user behavior analysis, and market trends in the gaming industry.

Similar datasets have been studied in the past, including:

1. The Steam Video Games Dataset by Nik Davis (2016) [2], which focused primarily on game metadata and user reviews but lacked detailed user behavioral data.

2. The Steam Game and Bundle Data by Austin Walker (2017) [3], which emphasized pricing strategies and bundle effectiveness but had limited user interaction information.

#### State-of-the-Art Methods

Current state-of-the-art methods for analyzing gaming platforms and user behavior include:

1. **Collaborative Filtering Approaches**
   - Matrix factorization techniques have shown significant success in game recommendation systems [4].
   - Hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering have demonstrated superior performance in handling the cold-start problem common in gaming platforms [5].

2. **Deep Learning Models**
   - Recent studies have employed deep neural networks to capture complex patterns in user-game interactions [6].
   - Attention mechanisms have been particularly effective in modeling temporal aspects of gaming behavior [7].

3. **Graph-based Methods**
   - Social network analysis approaches have been used to understand user communities and game popularity propagation [8].
   - Graph neural networks have shown promise in capturing the complex relationships between users, games, and genres [9].

#### Comparison with Existing Findings

Our findings align with several previous studies while also presenting some notable differences:

1. **Playtime-Recommendation Correlation**
   - Similar to previous research [10], we found a positive correlation between playtime and likelihood of recommendation.
   - However, our analysis revealed a more nuanced relationship, where extremely high playtime doesn't necessarily indicate a positive recommendation.

2. **Genre Influence**
   - Our findings support existing research [11] showing that genre preferences strongly influence user recommendations.
   - We observed stronger genre-based clustering effects compared to previous studies.

3. **Developer Impact**
   - While previous studies [12] suggested minimal developer influence on user recommendations, our analysis showed significant developer loyalty effects.

4. **Rating Patterns**
   - Our observations about rating distributions align with broader studies of digital distribution platforms [13].
   - However, we found more pronounced regional variations in rating patterns.

The methodological approaches we employed, particularly in handling data imbalance and feature selection, build upon established techniques while introducing novel combinations to address the specific challenges of our dataset.
