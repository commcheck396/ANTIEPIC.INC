### Literature Review

#### Dataset Origin and Previous Studies

The Steam dataset we used in this assignment was found in our course website, and it can also be found on Kaggle [1]. This dataset has been widely used in various research studies focusing on game recommendations, user behavior analysis, and market trends in the gaming industry.

Similar datasets have been studied in the past, including:

1. The Steam Video Games Dataset by Nik Davis (2019) [2], which focused primarily on game metadata and user reviews but lacked detailed user behavioral data. Gathered around May 2019, it contains most games on the store released prior to that date. Each row has a unique AppID and is usually a separate release, excepting some re-releases and remasters.

2. The Steam Game Dataset by Tamber (2016) [3], which emphasized user behavior data. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed
#### State-of-the-Art Methods

Current state-of-the-art methods for analyzing gaming platforms and user behavior include:

1. **Collaborative Filtering Approaches**
   - Matrix factorization techniques have shown significant success in game recommendation systems [4].
   - Hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering have demonstrated superior performance in handling the cold-start problem common in gaming platforms [5].

2. **Deep Learning Models**
   - Recent studies have employed deep neural networks to capture complex patterns in user-game interactions [6].
   - Attention mechanisms have been particularly effective in modeling temporal aspects of gaming behavior [7].

3. **Graph-based Methods**
   - Social network analysis approaches have been used to understand user communities and game popularity propagation [8].
   - Graph neural networks have shown promise in capturing the complex relationships between users, games, and genres [9].

#### Comparison with Existing Findings

Our results are consistent with several previous studies, but we also have some new findings:

1. **User and Game Similarity Analysis**
   - We discovered significant correlations between user similarity metrics and game recommendation patterns
   - Game similarity measures proved to be strong predictors of whether a user would recommend a particular game
   - The combination of both user and game similarities provided robust prediction capabilities

2. **Temporal Weight Impact**
   - Our analysis revealed that the temporal weighting of training data had a notable influence on recommendation predictions
   - More recent user behaviors showed stronger predictive power compared to historical data
   - The temporal aspect helped capture evolving user preferences and game quality perceptions

3. **Community Review Impact**
   - Other users' attitudes towards reviews served as valuable indicators for predicting game recommendations
   - The collective community response to reviews demonstrated strong correlation with individual recommendation likelihood
   - This highlighted the importance of social factors in game evaluation

4. **Historical Recommendation Patterns**
   - Users' previous recommendation histories proved effective in predicting game approval rates
   - We found consistent patterns in how past user behavior could indicate future game reception
   - This suggests stable user preferences and evaluation criteria over time

In conclusion, we use innovative approaches based on existing techniques in dealing with data imbalance and feature selection, and introduce novel feature combinations to solve the problems we study on this dataset.
