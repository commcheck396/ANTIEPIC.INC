### Task Description

The objective of this task is to predict whether **User A** will recommend **Game B**. This prediction is based on a combination of features that reflect user behavior, game characteristics, and the relationships between users and games.

### Features Considered

1. **Playtime and Recommendation Correlation**
   - **Description:** The relationship between User A’s playtime for Game B and their likelihood of recommending it.
   - **Hypothesis:** Users who spend more time playing a game are generally more likely to recommend it.
2. **Game Genre and Recommendation Correlation**
   - **Description:** The relationship between Game B’s genre and whether User A recommends it.
   - **Hypothesis:** If User A has previously played or recommended games of the same genre as Game B, they are more likely to recommend Game B. This is based on the assumption that users tend to favor genres they are familiar with or enjoy.
3. **Developer Influence**
   - **Description:** The impact of Game B’s developer on User A’s recommendation likelihood.
   - **Hypothesis:** If User A has previously played or recommended games developed by the same developer as Game B, this prior positive experience increases the likelihood of recommending Game B.
4. **Overall Positive Rating of Game B**
   - **Description:** The relationship between Game B’s overall positive rating and User A’s likelihood of recommending it.
   - **Hypothesis:** Games with higher overall positive ratings are more likely to be recommended by User A.

   - **Description:** The proportion of User A’s total reviews that are positive.
   - **Hypothesis:** Users with a higher recommendation rate are more inclined to recommend Game B.
6. **Jaccard Similarity Between Game B and Previously Recommended Games**
   - **Description:** The similarity between Game B and the games User A has previously recommended, measured using Jaccard similarity based on attributes such as tags.
   - **Hypothesis:** If Game B shares significant attributes with games that User A has recommended in the past, they are more likely to recommend Game B as well.
7. **Jaccard Similarity Between User A and Other Users Who Recommended Game B**
